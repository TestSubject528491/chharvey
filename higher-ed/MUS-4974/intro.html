	<h2>What is Ambisonics?</h2>
	<p>A <a target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ambisonics">formal definition</a> of Ambisonics is <q cite="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ambisonics">a system of sound reproduction that uses a combination of channels and speakers to produce an effect of surrounding the listener with the sound.</q></p>
	<p>Simply put, Ambisonics is immersive sound. An Ambisonic system is capable of recording and playing back sound that varies in all three spatial dimensions. What separates Ambisonics from other surround sound systems is that there is no limit to the number of output channels in an Ambisonic system.</p>
