<h1>Guest Artist Recital &#8211; John Salmon, piano</h1>

<h2>Friday, November 6, 8:00 PM, Squires Recital Salon</h2>

<h3>from the <i>Well-Tempered Claver</i>, Book I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J.S.
Bach</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The first thing
I noticed about the Prelude and Fugue in C Major was that Salmon uses pedal,
and it is common knowledge that the pedal wasn’t introduced on the piano until
the late Classical period. Salmon also distorts tempo by using rubato and
ritardando to bring out the primary voice. The piece is mellow, calming, and
reminds the listener of flowing water. There is not much range in dynamics,
which helps contribute to the imagery. The Fugue’s subjects were distinct and
clear, and the stretto and episode sections are played passionately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The Prelude and
Fugue in F Major is a cheerful, fast, and virtuosic piece in a &frac34;
dance-like meter. The Prelude is a 3:1 species counterpoint and the Fugue is
stated and confident. Salmon shows a wide range in articulation and makes obvious
the difference between staccato and legato passages. He transitions directly
into the Prelude and Fugue in F-Sharp Minor without pause, improvising the
transition. (This element is one of the topics of his workshop, “Ornamenting
Bach.”)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The Prelude and
Fugue in F-Sharp Minor is a thoughtful piece deep in meaning. The performer
expresses big dynamic contrast between the parts and uses rubato. The last few
bars of the Fugue are clearly improvised: Salmon doubles the octave in the left
hand and extends the piano register beyond that which existed in Bach’s time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>With another
improvisatory transition into the Prelude and Fugue in A Major, the piece
starts out somewhat tentative and hesitant but develops the material quickly.
Salmon seems lost in the music, oblivious to the environment around him. He
shows excitement, emotion, and facial expressions while playing. He has fun
with the piece, despite his position on stage in front of a live audience.</p>

<h3>Sonata No. 3 in C Major, Op. 2 No. 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L.V.
Beethoven</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The first movement
starts out in a gleeful exposition with virtuosic passages and melodies. The
silence in the first phrases and between the first and second theme groups is
striking. The closing theme is soft and melodious, played passionately and
carefully by the pianist. Beethoven takes us around the circle of fifths in the
development section, leading to a strong tonic in the recapitulation. He uses
octave jumps, double octaves, and octave tremolos in the restatement of the
theme groups. Beethoven introduces deceptive cadences, and rising diminished
sevenths chords by semitone, which present a degree of chromaticism. The
codetta and coda are strong and lively, evolving the repeated material.
Salmon’s hands are so agile and light that they float across the keys with
ease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Low octaves in
the second movement accompany light eighth notes in the right hand, a contrast
to the quarter-half-quarter note rhythm in the upper register. The third and
penultimate movement of the sonata is a short scherzo form with a playfully fast
and satirical tempo. The trio section is extremely dark, with long, thick,
fluid chords in the left hand that accompany fast light arpeggios in the right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>It is
interesting to note that this sonata, one of Beethoven’s earliest opuses,
contains four movements &#8211; most at the time had three. The final movement
is in compound duple meter. The lyrical and singing melody in addition to the
church-like choral in the second theme pose for an exciting end to the sonata.
Salmon’s mood is not only apparent in his music but also in his facial
expressions. He engages the audience in the performance.</p>

<h3>Glances&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave
Brubeck</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Brubeck is
greatly known for his stylistic aspects of parallel harmonies, modality, odd
rhythms and changing meters, and non-traditional chords. The Overture is a
bright piece that encompasses many of these aspects. It is not in major mode,
although it does sound diatonic and consonant. There are many hemiolas,
triplets, and other odd groupings in the melodies that contrast a steady
“boom-chick” beat in the bass. The piece loses a sense of pulse due to the
complex rhythms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Struttin’
employs jazzy rhythms and melodies with modern scale degrees such as m7, m3, +4,
and parallel fourths and frequent modulation. The swing beat, tremolo chords
(jazz hands), and syncopation make the piece easy to tap your foot to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>The placement
of Blue Aria is analogous to a classical third movement marked Adagio. The main
theme is a melancholy voice with a soft chord accompaniment. Long arpeggios in
the left hand with chords in the right hand build up to a strong forte in the B
section, and then the A section’s quiet melody returns with a jazzy variation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>Jazzy scale
degrees make their way into the last movement entitled Doin’ the Charleston.
The piece is polyphonic with equal voices in both hands. The piano seems to
sing.</p>

<h3>Improvisations on Themes by Dave Brubeck&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave
Brubeck</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in'>These last few
pieces of the night are improvisations by John Salmon on a select few of
Brubeck’s tunes. Salmon utilizes moving chords, walking baselines, and often
changes in style, texture, and meter. The melodies are not always apparent,
especially when he brings them in stealthily. However, the pieces really become
alive when he speeds the tempo and cranks the volume. Salmon’s music is so
visual that it sounds easy to orchestrate for jazz band. The listener can hear
the various instruments and their separate parts in the performance. His music
also produces imagery. The third tune, Three to Get Ready, is extremely
reminiscent of a calm walk in the park on a sunny weekend. The finale of the
concert is a busy conglomerate of single notes, dissonant chords, scales,
arpeggios, and fast repeated notes. This piece I suspect, unlike the others
that have been strictly improvisational, has been previously composed and
prepared by Salmon himself.</p>
