<p>Produce a multi-page, inter-linked website incorporating text,
graphics, media files that employs at least one cascading style sheet
for site-wide formatting. (We will finish covering the inclusion of
media files on Friday.)</p>

<p>The site should contain a complete, detailed and properly formatted
outline listing all the elements necessary to be addressed when
thoroughly answering the continuation exam question discussed in class:</p>
	
<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;">The dampers are lifted on a piano and a single key is struck. The resulting sound is recorded as a digital audio sound file; describe all of the events and processes that occur.</blockquote>
	
<p>This outline should be a minimum of four-levels deep (where
appropriate) and use a combination or ordered lists and CSS for proper
formatting as discussed in class.</p>

<p>In addition to the outline, there should be a (linked) page explaining
one of the major elements in detail. (for example, &ldquo;Microphones&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Analog Electrical Audio&rdquo; etc.)</p>
