	<p>Gershwin's music was more similar to jazz than it was to impressionist music written in the early 20<span class="superscript">th</span> Century. Both technically and musically challenging, <cite>Three Preludes for Piano</cite> demonstrates various styles and capabilities of the instrument and musician. Montgomery seems to hold back emotion when performing, although correctly expresses rhythm and note patterns. He hardly uses any pedal, which could be useful in some sections.</p>
