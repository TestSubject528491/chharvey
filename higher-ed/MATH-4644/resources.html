<section id="geometry">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Geometric Proofs</h1>

<section id="algebra">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Algebraic Rules</h1>
	<p class="prose"><a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFSrINhfNsQ">Teach Me How To Factor</a> rap performed by students of <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.westerville.k12.oh.us/school_home.aspx?schoolID=31">Westerville South High School</a>, located in Westerville, OH.</p>

<section id="powers">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Exponent, Radical, and Logarithmic Rules</h1>
	<p class="prose">This site lists the <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/exponent.htm">basic rules of exponents</a>, and includes practice problems.</p>
	<p class="prose">For <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.mathwords.com/r/radical_rules.htm">rules involving radicals</a>, another site includes definitions and examples. This site also explains <strong>common mistakes</strong> that students make regarding these rules.</p>
	<p class="prose">Radicals (roots) are the inverses of powers, and logarithms are the inverses of exponents. Here's a site with general <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/logs/log4/log44/log44.html">logarithm rules</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="trig">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Trigonometric Identities</h1>
	<p class="prose">This resource is a web site full of cool diagrams and explanations of the <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.themathpage.com/atrig/trigonometric-identities.htm">Trigonometric Identities</a>. Not only does it group the formulas into categories, but it provides a proof of a few identites! So you can use this page to help remember your trig identities, and if you're extra ambitious, you can learn <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> some of them work!</p>
	<p class="prose">Another website with proofs of more <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://oakroadsystems.com/twt/">complicated Trig Idens</a>. This site makes connections to harder concepts such as Euler's Formula, complex numbers, and polar coordinates. If you think you can take the heat, take a peek!</p>

<section id="stat">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Statistics</h1>
	<p class="prose">This <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/z_table.html">normal distribution calculator</a> finds the area under any normal distribution between two bounds, including infinite bounds. Use this tool in case you don't have your <a class="a a-sp a-sp-reg" href="/MATH-4644/technology/handhelds/graphcalcs.html">graphing calculator</a> with you.</p>
</section>
<section id="calculus">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Calculus Rules</h1>
	<p class="prose">This small Web page contains basic <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.mathacademy.com/pr/prime/articles/dif_rule/index.asp">differentiation rules</a>, in addition to derivatives of exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse trigonometric functions. Don't forget to use the <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://zweigmedia.com/RealWorld/proofs/chainruleproof.html">chain rule</a>!</p>
	<p class="prose">This is a large <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.integral-table.com/">table of integrals</a> with every form you can possibly think of. There are no proofs included.</p>
	<p class="prose">Here are some  <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://2000clicks.com/MathHelp/CalculusIntegralTableOfIntegrals.aspx">proofs of basic integrals</a>.</p>
	<p class="prose"><a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://calculusapplets.com/">This website</a> has 78 different interactive applets useful for reviewing topics in calculus. They are also great for lesson plans.</p>
	<p class="prose">Like most students, you may have difficulty interpreting the <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/visual.calculus/4/ftc.9/">Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</a>. What does it actually say? Check out these comprehensive and visually interactive examples, applications, and proofs of the Theorem.</p>
	<p class="prose">What's the <span class="tex">\(dx\)</span> for, anyway? Find out all about <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/kenny/papers/dx.html">differentials</a> and what they actually mean.</p>

<section id="analysis">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Real and Complex Analysis</h1>
	<p class="prose">Ever wonder how you would graph a complex function? Well, you can't. We would need to live in a four-dimensional world to see such a graph. However, you may be able to see <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/java/Complex.html">one or a few points at a time</a> to get a brief picture.</p>

<section id="readings">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Readings</h1>
	<p class="prose">Check out <a class="a a-reg" target="_blank" href="http://www.math-ed-research.blogspot.com/">my blog</a>! Conceived as a class assignment, I was required to journal my reactions to research in math education. I thought it was a good idea to keep up with the blog, so you might find a new post every now and again.</p>
