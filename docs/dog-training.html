<p class="prose">The number one rule of dog training is to make it clear who is in charge. The first step in showing your authority is letting your dog know that you control all the resources. You must provide the food, water, bedding, toys, and everything your dog wants and needs. Your dog must have the idea that he can only use these resources with your permission. <strong class="philosophy">Dogs crave leadership.</strong> They feel comfortable being told what to do and when to do it. Training with this basic concept in mind will make developing your relationship with your dog all the easier.</p>
<section id="training">
	<h1 class="h h-beta">Training is Teaching</h1>
	<p class="prose">The relationship between you and your dog should be similar to that between teacher and pupil. Though <strong class="philosophy">dogs crave leadership</strong>, it is best to think of you as <em>teaching</em> your dog rather than <em>dominating</em> him. The best system of learning involves timely and effective rewards and proper management.</p>
	<section id="reward">
		<h1 class="h h-gamma">Effective Rewards and <i>The Mark</i></h1>
		<p class="prose">Also known as <i>positive reinforcement</i>, effective rewarding involves introducing a desired stimulus (such as treats, petting, praise), at the appearance of a behavior (such as sitting, fetching, or, possibly inadvertently, whining), thus increasing the frequency of that behavior. One example would be giving your dog a treat shortly after sitting at your command. An example of <em>accidental</em> effective rewarding would be comforting your dog while he's whining.</p>
		<p class="prose">Having a marker, or <i>Mark</i>, can be a really useful asset when effectively rewarding your dog. Some trainers use a clicker, while I use the simple and clean keyword <q><b class="keyword">Yes</b></q>. Using a Mark allows your dog to understand that <strong class="message">the behavior he exhibits when hearing the Mark is desired</strong>. Here's an example. I tell Axel to <b class="keyword">Sit</b>, and then he puts his butt down. Without a Mark, I would praise <b class="keyword">Good Boy</b>, and then present a treat. To receive the treat, he would have to stand up and come forward to take it. Now think about what kind of message the dog is receiving. He's being given a treat while standing up. Thus he associates the treat with standing up, and the action of standing up with the keyword <b class="keyword">Sit</b>. Training without a Mark is possible but takes much more time.</p>
		<p class="prose">With a Mark, the desired behavior is more clear. After a few days of simply treating to the keyword <b class="keyword">Yes</b>, Axel starts to form an association between <b class="keyword">Yes</b> and treats. This essential period <small>in which I'm literally saying <b class="keyword">Yes</b> and then giving Axel a treat</small> may seem like a waste of time, but it really pays off in the long run. During training, I tell Axel to <b class="keyword">Sit</b>, and then he puts his butt down. The moment his butt touches the ground, I say <b class="keyword">Yes</b>, with which Axel will have already formed the association to treats. Thus he knows that something good is coming, which just so happens to be at the same time his butt touches the ground. The association between that good feeling and putting his butt down is made. I can then wait sufficiently longer to treat him, and he still knows he's being treated for the sit, which happened ages ago.</p>
		<section>
			<h1 class="h h-delta">The Hierarchy of Rewards</h1>
			<p class="prose">In the domain of treats, dogs definitely have a preference. Scrumptious bits of ground beef and steak rise to the top of the list, followed shortly by savory dried bacon and dried salmon. Luckily, these are satisfactorily cheaper than commercial dog treats and can be found in any grocery store. Save these treats only for the <a class="a" href="#emergency-come">Emergency Come</a>, lest you pamper your dog. Then comes the common flavored pellets and jerky you can find in your pet store. Though a bit more expensive, they're worth the price since your dog will do anything for a taste of these. After that, we start hitting the lower end of the spectrum with bits of egg or cheese, and then finally, dog biscuits and dog cookies are on the bottom of the list. They'd be good for a mid-day snack, but otherwise not really effective as a training reward.</p>
			<p class="prose">When it comes to praise, <strong class="philosophy">dogs value vocalization most of all</strong>. Unlike cats, who prefer a soft touch, dogs like to <em>hear</em> the praise of their owners. Petting is good too, but your dog will appreciate verbal praise over physical praise any time. The higher the pitch of your voice, the more he will like it.</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section id="management" style="page-break-before: always;">
		<h1 class="h h-gamma">Proper Management</h1>
		<p class="prose">To stop bad behavior, dog trainers in the past have resorted to positive punishment: introducing an undesired stimulus to a behavior, thus decreasing the behavior. In today's view, this is unethical, inefficient, and unproductive. The preferred method involves proper management.</p>
		<p class="prose">Proper Management is simply <strong>eliminating the possibility for failure</strong>. A great example is counter-surfing. Axel used to love to jump on the counter. This was probably caused by one incident of licking even the tiniest of crumbs off the counter, thus sending the message that good things come from the countertop. To <i>manage</i> the situation, I kept making sure the counter was absolutely spotless. Axel may have jumped up again, but didn't find any goodies, therefore this behavior diminished over time. There was no need to introduce an undesired stimulus.</p>
		<p id="punishment" class="prose">That being said, some situations do deserve positive punishment. At these incidents, a simple <b class="keyword">No!</b> or <b class="keyword">Bad Dog!</b> will suffice. <strong>Never hit your dog.</strong> Frequent positive punishment is not recommended, however. First of all, positive punishment, just like positive reinforcement, must take place <a class="a" href="#delayed-stimuli">in the act</a>. Not all times can you catch your dog in the act, so punishing him after the fact won't do a bit of good. Secondly, as a dog trainer, you need to <em>teach</em> what is desired and what is undesired. Punishing bad behavior forces the dog to guess what is the desired behavior, of which there are infinitely many possibilities. In other words, he knows what <em>not</em> to do, but must deduce what he <em>is</em> to do. And in a lot of cases, the dog has no idea what he is being punished for, because he is likely doing many things at once. Through a system of trial and error, the dog has to figure out and narrow down what behavior he is being punished for and what behavior is expected of him. This leads to a complicated relationship involving fear, desperate pleasing, and low self-esteem.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="delayed-stimuli">
		<h1 class="h h-gamma">Catching Your Dog In The Act</h1>
		<p class="prose"><strong class="philosophy">Dogs live in the moment.</strong> They do have long-term memory, but these memories are often buried deep inside their minds at an unconscious level. Most dogs can't remember what happened two minutes ago. Thus <strong>it is imperative to treat your dog's behavior immediately</strong>. With <a class="a" href="#reward">rewards</a>, give the Mark, if you're using it, at the first sign of the desired action. Don't wait even a second, or else your dog will not know what is being Marked. If you're not using a Mark, treat immediately. <a class="a" href="#punishment">Punishments</a>, if applicable, must take place during or immediately after the undesired behavior occurs. If you come home after work and find your furniture destroyed and garbage all over the floor, the absolute best thing you can do is to clean up and learn from the situation.</p>
		<p class="prose">Dogs are not intelligent enough to understand grudges, let alone hold them. Though it may appear so, there is no such thing as <i>spite</i> in the dog world. Dogs also don't feel guilt. Their display of submissive behavior is to show that they're trying to please their leaders, not because they <q>know that what they did was wrong</q>.</p>

	<section id="walking">
		<h1 class="h h-gamma">Walking</h1>
		<p class="prose">Walking is a very crucial part of your dog's day. This is the time he ventures out into the neighborhood, takes in the multitude of scents and smells, interacts with neighborhood dogs and other animals (including people), and perhaps most importantly, marks his territory. <small>Territory marking is a very serious business for dogs. We may not realize it, but dogs are very particular about where, when, how much, and how often they pee.</small> Thus, walking your dog is an incredible bonding activity, and is the time when you and your dog get to know each other the most.</p>
		<p class="prose">It is important to communicate with your dog while Walking. Even if it's just small talk, your dog loves hearing your voice. When you see something interesting, such as a frantically-scurrying squirrel or a plastic bag floating by, mention it! Say things like, <q>Look!</q> or <q>What's that??</q> Your dog has probably already noticed it before you did, but just showing interest (or at least pretending to) is enough to get him excited.</p>
		<p id="pack-walking" class="prose">Another big part of Walking is known as <i>Pack Walking</i>. Pack Walking is what dogs instinctively do with each other: they walk in packs with a clear indication of who is Alpha male. In your pack, you are the Alpha male. You decide when to go out for a walk, in what direction to go, when to pee, when to run, and when to say hi to other dogs. Let your dog understand this. Your dog should be mostly at your side or a little bit in front. There should be slack in the leash; if not, tug firmly until your dog backs up (or moves forward, if you're dragging him) to meet you. <b class="keyword">Heel</b> is a great tool if mastered properly.</p>
		<p id="walking-order" class="prose">In the human world, letting a person enter or leave before you is a sign of courtesy. In the dog world, this is a sign of submission. When about to enter or leave a room, always make your dog <b class="keyword">Sit</b> and <b class="keyword">Stay</b> before crossing the threshold, then release him. When you make your dog wait for you to walk through the doorway first, you're saying, <q class="message">Going this way is my decision. You must follow me, but only until I say so.</q></p>
	</section>
	<section id="eating">
		<h1 class="h h-gamma">Eating</h1>
		<p class="prose">Part of showing your dog who's in charge is showing him who has control of the resources&mdash;including the food. In your pack, the person feeding the dog should be the same all the time. This person is viewed as the person who controls the food. Once a week, this person should hand-feed the dog. It may be kind of gross, but forcing your dog to eat out of your hand conveys, <q class="message">I provide and control the food, and you can eat it with my permission.</q></p>
		<p id="eating-order" class="prose">The second component of this leadership is making your dog wait until you're done eating before he eats. In the dog world, the Alpha male eats the prime food and the rest of the pack can have the scraps left over, once the Alpha is finished. But the leadership comes with a price: While the rest of the pack is eating, the Alpha must be on the lookout and provide protection for his pack.</p>
		<p class="prose">An effective way to make sure your dog knows its dinner time is by using a signal phrase, like mine: <q><b class="keyword">Are You Hungry?</b></q> Prepare the dog food before you start eating (this can be after you're done cooking the human food) so the dog knows it's time to eat. The smell also gets his saliva glands working so he gets hungry fast. You should expect your dog to wait patiently (<em>not beg</em>) in the kitchen, while you're eating.
	</section>
	<section id="greetings">
		<h1 class="h h-gamma">Greetings</h1>
		<p class="prose">Ten minutes before you leave, put your dog in his crate if he has one, and cover it completely. Get your keys and jacket ready, pack your items, then chill out for a ten minutes. This down-time between getting ready to leave and actually leaving eases your dog's anxiety about your departure. Give him time to settle down before you leave. Your leaving should be no big deal to your dog. To him, it should seem like you're just in the other room. You should convey the message, <q class="message">I'll be gone for a short while, but not to worry, I'll be back soon.</q></p>
		<p class="prose">Your arrivals should be low-key too. The biggest mistake new dog owners make when coming home after work is greeting their dogs with lots of praise, love, hugs, and kisses. Giving your dog this kind of attention only exacerbates his anxiety. His time away from you will seem all the longer and become that much unbearable. He will become impatient, frustrated, and depressed.  When you get home, completely ignore your dog, including not making eye contact, for at least 5 minutes. Use this time to unpack and unwind. Then you can acknowledge his presence with calm and soft petting and praise. There is a time for lovey-dovey (e.g. playtime), but it is not during your entrances and exits.</p>

		<h1 class="h h-gamma">Miscellaneous Tips</h1>
		<h2 class="h h-delta">Crating</h2>
		<p id="crating" class="prose">Dogs are creatures that like to sleep in dark and enclosed spaces. Canines' ancestors used to dig big holes in the ground for sleeping to protect themselves from predators. Others used to live in small caves. These dens were where the canines slept, ate, nursed, and felt safe. Giving Axel a crate lets him know, <q class="message">This is your room. You can personalize it how you want. You can feel safe here.</q> I use the command <b class="keyword">Go To Bed</b> to tell him it's time to go to his crate. Axel's crate is where he stays when I leave. It's a place he can take his kongs, bones, and toys. He can bury them in there too. I keep his crate covered to let in just enough light for him to see. Crate training is also a great way to house train a dog. A dog will never eliminate in a place he calls <i>his room</i> unless he's ill or cannot possibly hold it in any longer. These cases are clearly not your dog's fault, so punishment is out of the question.</p>
