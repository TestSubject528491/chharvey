OUTLINE:
========
unordered lists vs ordered lists
If the order matters (a.k.a. changing the order changes 
	the meaning of the list or changes the result),
	then it should be an ordered list. If not,
	unordered.
Examples:
A grocery list should be unordered,
	UNLESS it is written in order of priority.
	Note: ANY list CAN be made into an ordered list, as long as a
	(maybe arbitrary) specification is given.
	Whether it SHOULD, is a different story.
		<small>(Read <a class="a a-sp a-sp-reg" href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/complex_compare.shtml">this</a> on the lexicographical ordering of the complex numbers.)</small>
A recipe is my favorite example of an ordered list because
	changing the order of steps could result in one fucked up cake.

named list items: 
	the order of the list may be irrelevant, 
	yet one may want to refer to a particular list item.
For example, on a grocery list, "see the third bullet"
	sounds less elegant than "see number 3" (Eggs). Ideally, the items'
	names should NOT be connected to the order in which they
	appear, because changing the order changes the names. So "Eggs" is
	not necessarily always number 3.
Clearly, in an ordered list, we already have a solution. The order of the items
	is relevant, and we still have a robust naming system. Yes, changing
	the order changes the names, but now we have a "different" list so
	it's okay.
But with unordered lists, whose items need to be named, 
	we need to come up with a <b>new naming convention</b>.
