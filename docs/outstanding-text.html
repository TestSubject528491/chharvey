		<h1 class="h-beta">Abstract</h1>
		<p class="prose">This document was written in attempt to organize and simplify common and key uses of outstanding text. When writing documents and Web sites in HTML, authors use many different semantics and styles to highlight diction, and the most common are discussed and distinguished here. Although it may appear so, this is not in any way an attempt to explain the differences between the previous and current version of HTML. It is merely a summary to use as a reference. In the descriptions of items, direct quotes (with links) of the W3C Recommendations are included, supplemented by my own interpretations. I have also supplied more examples for further clarification.</p>

	<p class="prose">It is important to recognize that the elements in Semantic Markup serve a solely logical purpose. The elements discussed below represent parts of a document that convey meaning, rather than how they are presented. Styles and stylesheets can be changed to reformat the presentation of these elements, and stylistic aspects are discussed in another section. Readers beware, nevertheless, that this page abides by some purposeful style rules, and perhaps those unintended by the rendering browser.</p>

			<h1 class="h-delta">The <b class="ot-elem">em</b> Element</h1>
			<a class="box box-block box-block-a box-block-a-reg" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-em-element">
				<blockquote class="q-block" cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-em-element">
					<p>The <b class="ot-elem">em</b> element represents stress emphasis of its contents. The level of emphasis that a particular piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor <b class="ot-elem">em</b> elements. The placement of emphasis <strong>changes the meaning of the sentence</strong><ins><small> [importance added]</small></ins>. The element thus forms an integral part of the content. The precise way in which emphasis is used in this way depends on the language.</p>
				</blockquote>
			</a>
			<p class="prose">Authors should use the <b class="ot-elem">em</b> element to represent words or phrases that are stressed, as if the tone of voice of the speaker speaking the phrase would be affected. More importantly, <strong>the placement of stress should affect the meaning of the passage</strong>. If the emphasis were to be removed or relocated, the passage's meaning should change.</p>
			<figure class="examp">
				<p>Do you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to buy those jeans?</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">In this example, the emphasis is on the word <i>need</i>, implying that the author does not want the shopper to spend his/her money.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure class="examp">
				<p>Do you need to buy &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; jeans?</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">This example's meaning contrasts from the first. The emphasis is on the word <i>those</i>, implying that the author is recommending that the shopper choose a different pair of jeans.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure class="examp">
				<p>Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; walk on the lawn.</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">In this example, the tone of voice is stern because the word <i>not</i> is emphasized. Even if the emphasis were removed, though, the meaning of the passage would remain the same, so the <b class="ot-elem">em</b> element is not the best choice. A <b class="ot-elem">strong</b> element might better suit this highlight.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<figure class="examp">
				<p>Do not &lt;em&gt;walk&lt;/em&gt; on the lawn.</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">This time, the word <i>walk</i> is emphasized, implying that it would be okay to run or drive on the lawn. The placement of the <b class="ot-elem">em</b> element is obviously not very practical, so the element's use in this manner is not recommended.</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</section>
		<section id="strong">
			<h1 class="h-delta">The <b class="ot-elem">strong</b> Element</h1>
			<a class="box box-block box-block-a box-block-a-reg" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-strong-element">
				<blockquote class="q-block" cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-strong-element">
					<p>The <b class="ot-elem">strong</b> element represents strong importance for its contents. The relative level of importance of a piece of content is given by its number of ancestor strong elements; each strong element increases the importance of its contents. Changing the importance of a piece of text with the strong element does <em>not</em><ins><small> [emphasis added]</small></ins> change the meaning of the sentence.</p>
				</blockquote>
			</a>
			<p class="prose">Authors should use the <b class="ot-elem">strong</b> element to represent text that has a level of importance. Important text does not necessarily affect tone of voice (although it may), but rather upsets the normal prose by causing the reader to examine the text more carefully. The placement of importance should not affect the meaning of the passage.</p>
			<figure class="examp">
				<p>The connections between ideas, &lt;strong&gt;rather than the ideas themselves&lt;/strong&gt;, define understanding.</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">Here, the author makes it clear what is really significant when defining understanding. The passage would have the same meaning if the importance were removed, or even if the important text itself were removed:
					<p>The connections between ideas define understanding.</p>
				</figcaption>

		<section id="mark">
			<h1 class="h-delta">The <b class="ot-elem">mark</b> Element</h1>
			<a class="box box-block box-block-a box-block-a-reg" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-mark-element">
				<blockquote class="q-block" cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-mark-element">
					<p>The <b class="ot-elem">mark</b> element represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes, due to its relevance in another context. When used in a quotation or other block of text referred to from the prose, it indicates a highlight that was not originally present but which has been added to bring the reader's attention to a part of the text that might not have been considered important by the original author when the block was originally written, but which is now under previously unexpected scrutiny. When used in the main prose of a document, it indicates a part of the document that has been highlighted due to its likely relevance to the user's current activity.</p>
				</blockquote>
			</a>
			<p class="prose">Authors should use the <b class="ot-elem">mark</b> element to represent phrases that are relevant to a particular subject <strong>in a different context</strong>. In an article about black holes, for example, the author may want to mark up anything that has to do with the <b>Law of Conservation of Information</b> in one way, and mark up any phrases involving <b>string theory</b> in another way (using classes, perhaps&#x2014;the reviewer could style different contexts accordingly). The <b class="ot-elem">mark</b> element is ideal because these two subjects are not directly related to the article's main topic. Readers will be drawn to the corresponding subjects more efficiently.</p>

				<p>Teachers need to continually seek improvement on their own part. As a teacher I plan to &lt;mark&gt;continue my exposure to research&lt;/mark&gt; so that my teaching practices will be continually improving. This is furthermore in the best interest of the students.</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">The passage above is about teachers adapting their teaching methods and techniques. The author decided to mark up the phrase <q>continue my exposure to research</q> for readers who are interested in teachers conducting and/or reading research.</figcaption>

				<blockquote class="q-block" cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-i-element">
					<p>The <b class="ot-elem">i</b> element represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, or some other prose whose typical typographic presentation is italicized.</p>
				</blockquote>
			</a>
			<p class="prose">Authors should use the <b class="ot-elem">i</b> element to represent phrases that are conveyed in an alternate voice, mood, or language, and <em>some</em> proper nouns such as periodical titles or ship names, <i lang="la">etc.</i> As the W3C states, the <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;i&gt;</code> tag should mark up elements that are <em>typically</em> presented in italic text, but not <em>necessarily</em>. Personally, it seems this definition is a bit cyclic and somewhat depends on presentation. I like to use this element, along with italic presentation, to represent journal titles and book titles in  <a class="a a-sp a-sp-reg" href="http://www.apastyle.org/">APA</a> citations. Contrary to the W3C specification, I would not use the <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;i&gt;</code> tag to mark up <q cite="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/text-level-semantics.html#the-i-element">technical terms</q>. For those, I would use <a class="a a-reg" href="#b">the <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;b&gt;</code> tag</a>.</p>

				<p>While boarding the &lt;i&gt;Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; yesterday, I was reading an interesting article published in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;.</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">The ship name <q>Enterprise</q> and the periodical title <q><a class="a a-reg" href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a></q> are marked with the <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;i&gt;</code> tag.</figcaption>

			<figure class="examp">
				<p>My operating system is named after the &lt;i&gt;Panthera leo&lt;/i&gt;, which is the species commonly referred to as the lion.</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">The <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;i&gt;</code> tag is used to mark up the taxonomic classification, in Latin, of an organism. When writing in other languages, authors may want to use the <i>class</i> and/or <i>lang</i> attributes to make a distinction. For example, <code class="box code nowrap"><span class="ot-tag">&lt;i lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;</span>Panthera leo<span class="ot-tag">&lt;/i&gt;</span></code> designates Latin language.</figcaption>

				<p>During test-taking, intellectual concentration and emotional tension create a learning situation &lt;i lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;. Beware: too much emotional tension may cause test takers to give up and think, &lt;i&gt;&lt;i lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;C'est la vie!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">Here, the <b class="ot-elem">i</b> element is used to convey more instances of foreign languages. In the first sentence, the Latin used is not a proper noun as it were in the example above. In the second sentence, one <b class="ot-elem">i</b> element is nested inside another <b class="ot-elem">i</b> element. These two elements serve different purposes: the inner <b class="ot-elem">i</b> element represents an expression in French, and the outer <b class="ot-elem">i</b> element represents an altered voice in the form of a thought. <small>Note the order of nesting of <b class="ot-elem">i</b> elements in the second sentence. Since the thought was in French, the element representing the French language should be nested inside the element representing the thought.</small></figcaption>

			<a class="box box-block box-block-a box-block-a-reg" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-b-element">
				<blockquote class="q-block" cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-b-element">
					<p>The <b class="ot-elem">b</b> element represents a span of text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical typographic presentation is boldened&#x2026; Another case where the b element is appropriate is in marking up the lede (or lead) sentence or paragraph&#x2026; The <b class="ot-elem">b</b> element should be used as a last resort when no other element is more appropriate.</p>
				</blockquote>
			</a>
			<p class="prose">Authors should use the <b class="ot-elem">b</b> element to represent text that indicates smaller proper nouns or specific terms. As the W3C states, the <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;b&gt;</code> tag should mark up elements that are <em>typically</em> presented in bold text, but not <em>necessarily</em>. Although some proper nouns are conventionally italicized such as periodical or book titles, there are some proper nouns of smaller significance, such as song and movie titles (not typically boldened) or headings in a document or table (typically boldened). I disagree with the W3C on marking up the lede sentence/paragraph with the <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;b&gt;</code> tag. For that, I would use a sub-heading, or <a class="up" href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/spec.html#status-of-this-document">I would request an entirely new element altogether</a>. I think of the <b class="ot-elem">b</b> element as a miscellaneous element, to be used when nothing else is suitable.</p>

				<p>Logical operators such as &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; are important in the use of everyday language. For example, teachers must make the distinction between the word &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; in English and the operator &lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt; in logic.</p>
				<figcaption class="cap">Here, there is a very fine line between the uses of <b class="ot-elem">b</b> and <b class="ot-elem">i</b>. In the first sentence, <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;b&gt;</code> marks up key words as in the first example. In the second sentence, the first occurrence of the word <q>or</q> is marked up with <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;i&gt;</code> because it offsets prose in an alternate voice: the author is writing specifically about a word. The second occurrence, however, is marked up with <code class="box code ot-tag">&lt;b&gt;</code> because again, it refers to a key word.</figcaption>
