	<p class="prose">Grade Seven Mathematics is the standard mathematics course taken by students in their second year of secondary education. Students who successfully complete the <a class="sp" href="http://doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/mathematics/index.shtml">Grade Seven Standards of Learning</a> should prepare to study <a>Algebra I</a> in eighth grade. Students who need reinforcing of mathematical abilities before Algebra I should prepare to enroll in <a>Grade Eight Mathematics</a>.</p>

<section id="grading">
	<h1 class="h-beta">Grading Policy</h1>
	<p>Students' grades for each marking period in Mr. Harvey's class are categorized as follows:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Benchmark Exam <small>(EXAM)</small></dt>
		<dd>10%</dd>
		<dt>High Stakes Tests/Projects <small>(TEST)</small></dt>
		<dd>30%</dd>
		<dt>Standards-Based Grades <small>(SBG)</small></dt>
		<dd>25%</dd>
		<dt>Open-Book Quizzes <small>(QUIZ)</small></dt>
		<dd>15%</dd>
		<dt>Homework/Classwork <small>(HWCW)</small></dt>
		<dd>20%</dd>
	</dl>
	<section id="categories">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Grade Categories</h1>
		<p class="prose">The Benchmark Exam is an end-of-quarter exam that tests all the material that has been covered that quarter, and serves as a predictor of how the student will perform on the end-of course test.</p>
		<p class="prose">High-Stakes Tests/Projects test students' mathematical abilities and knowledge of a general unit. Only the final product is graded, so the process (studying, preparation, etc.) is not evaluated. These grades are based on correctness and are judged by a rubric or criterion.</p>
		<p class="prose">Standards-Based Grades test students' performance on learning objectives mandated by the State. The quizzes are administered to show teacher and students a snapshot of their proficiency with the standards. The quizzes are mostly graded on correctness, however the student's progress and level of proficiency is taken into account. Students will receive letter grades for achievement:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>A+</dt>
			<dd>mastered</dd>
			<dt>B+</dt>
			<dd>proficient</dd>
			<dt>C+</dt>
			<dd>partially proficient</dd>
			<dt>D+</dt>
			<dd>working towards proficiency</dd>
			<dt>F</dt>
			<dd>unsatisfactory</dd>
		</dl>
		<p class="prose">Open-Book Quizzes act as stepping-stones to the Standards-Based Quizzes. They are very short, testing students' understanding of specific concepts. Notes and homework may be used during these quizzes, so students who study and practice nightly will benefit.</p>
		<p class="prose">Homework, classwork, and in-class activities help teacher and students obtain a view of the progress they are making towards understanding a topic. They are graded only on completion and participation, assuming there is evidence of a reasonable effort. See <a href="#homework">Homework Policy</a> below.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="retake">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Retake Policy</h1>
		<p class="prose">Students that receive 70% or lower on any High-Stakes Test will be given exactly one chance to retake that test. The retake must be scheduled with Mr. Harvey, outside of class, within 5 school days of receipt of test score. The student's final test grade will result in a weighted average of the two test scores: 30% of the first test score and 70% of the retake score. Students may not retake tests from previous quarters.</p>
		<p class="prose">Students are offered an unlimited number of chances to retake the Standard-Based Quizzes within each quarter. If a student attempts a quiz multiple times, the final quiz grade is based on the <strong>trend</strong> of the previous attempts. Students may not retake quizzes from previous quarters.</p>
		<p class="prose">The Benchmark Exam and Open-Book Quizzes may not be retaken.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="makeup">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Make-Up Work Policy</h1>
		<p>Students needing to make up work should follow the steps below to catch up on what they missed:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>First, check Mr. Harvey's website and/or online calendar.</li>
			<li>If #1 fails, ask a classmate.</li>
			<li>If #2 fails, email Mr. Harvey</li>
			<li>If all else fails, please see Mr. Harvey in school, during Lunch or Soar.</li>
		</ol>

	</section>
	<section id="homework">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Homework Policy</h1>
		<p class="prose">Students will be given homework on a daily basis. Homework assignments are expected to be complete by the due date, however students are permitted more time if needed. There is almost no penalty for late homework within each unit, however, only homework that is complete may be used for the Open-Book Quizzes.</p>
		<p class="prose">Each student's homework progress will be recorded in their personal homework log, which will be kept at school. When a student receives credit for homework, Mr. Harvey will stamp the homework log for that item. Mr. Harvey will collect the homework log at the end of the unit, at which point the students' score will be entered in the grade book. Homework will not be accepted after the homework log for that unit is collected.</p>
		<p class="prose">It is the student's responsibility to keep track of his or her homework progress and make up missing homework accordingly. Parents who wish to be kept in the loop on their child's homework progress may make special arrangements with Mr. Harvey.</p>
