	<section>
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Warm-up</h1>
		<p>Hand students the <a title="a worksheet with many single-operation problems">Math Facts</a> worksheet. Tell them that they have 5 minutes to complete as many problems as possible. This will get the wheels turning and get them ready for the lesson. It can also serve as a game or contest.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Different ways multiplication can appear:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>cross: <span class="latex">\(3\times 5\)</span></li>
				<li>dot: <span class="latex">\(3\cdot 5\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="vocab">juxtaposition</span> of constants: <span class="latex">\(3(5)\)</span>, <span class="latex">\((3)5\)</span>, or <span class="latex">\((3)(5)\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="vocab">juxtaposition</span> of variables: <span class="latex">\(3x\)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Different ways division can appear:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>division sign: <span class="latex">\(15\div 3\)</span></li>
				<li>fraction: <span class="latex">\(\frac{15}{3}\)</span></li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Students should practice turning multiplication signs into juxtaposition before performing any operations. Likewise, turn division signs into fractions. This will help students see the <b class="keyword">terms</b> in an expression, so they need not worry about memorizing the order of operations.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Steps to perform before evaluating an expression:</p>
			<ol class="main-idea">
				<li>Turn all multiplication into <span class="vocab">juxtaposition</span>.</li>
				<li>Turn all division into fractions.</li>
				<li>Add or subtract the <span class="vocab">terms</span> from left to right.</li>
			</ol>
			<figure>
				<p>Example: <span class="latex">\(2+3\times 5\)</span></p>
				<p>Rewrite as <span class="latex">\(2+(3)(5)\)</span>. Now we have two terms: one is the <span class="latex">\(2\)</span> and one is the <span class="latex">\((3)(5)\)</span>. The first one can't be simplified, and the second one must be simplified to <span class="latex">\(15\)</span>. Now just compute <span class="latex">\(2+15\)</span>.</p>
			</figure>
		</blockquote>
		<aside class="informal">
			<h1 class="h-delta">Optional Discussion</h1>
			<p class="lede">Why does multiplication come before addition?</p>
			<p>Multiplication of whole numbers is defined as repeated addition. For example, <span class="latex">\(3\times 5 = 3+3+3+3+3\)</span> and <span class="latex">\(5\times 3 = 5+5+5\)</span>. Students do not yet need to be aware that multiplication is commutative, however they will most likely derive this fact anyway.</p>
			<p><q>Since multiplication can be changed into addition, we can change all multiplication problems into addition problems.</q> Use a multiplication problem from the warm-up as an example; give 1 to 2 practice problems.</p>
			<p>Now give a multiplication problem such as <span class="latex">\(2+3\times 5\)</span>. Ask, <q>What should I do first? Well, we know what multiplication is: it's really addition!</q> Then change the problem to <span class="latex">\(2+3+3+3+3+3\)</span> and ask them to compute.</p>
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Guided Practice</h1>
		<p>Have students work on these problems independently or in groups. For extra practice, have them <strong>count the terms</strong> in each expression.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Practice problems:</p>
			<ol style="line-height: 3em;">
				<li><span class="latex">\(5+10\times 10\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="latex">\(6\times 7 + 1\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="latex">\(5\times 1+9+5\div 1\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="latex">\(10\times 4+12+5-2\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="latex">\(7+4\times 5+11-3\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="latex">\(6+11\times 4+12\div 12\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="latex">\(12\times 10+5\times 5+8\)</span></li>
				<li><span class="latex">\(14\div 2\times 8+3\)</span></li>
			</ol>

		<h1 class="h-gamma">Assessment</h1>
		<p>Formative: The student will be given the problems below to complete without aid. Their answers will be collected and immediate feedback will be given.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="latex">\(8-1\times 5 + 7\)</span> (answer: 10)</li>
			<li><span class="latex">\(87-2\times 40\)</span> (answer: 7)</li>
			<li><span class="latex">\(30\div 2\times 4\)</span> (answer: 60)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Give students the <a>crossword puzzle</a> to complete for homework.</p>
