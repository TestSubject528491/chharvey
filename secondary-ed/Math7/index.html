<p class="prose">Grade Seven Mathematics is the standard mathematics course taken by students in their second year of secondary education. Students who successfully complete the <a class="sp" href="http://doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/mathematics/index.shtml">Grade Seven Standards of Learning</a> should prepare to study <a>Algebra I</a> in eighth grade. Students who need reinforcing of mathematical abilities before Algebra I should prepare to enroll in <a>Grade Eight Mathematics</a>.</p>
<p class="prose">This page describes in general each Unit of the Math 7 curriculum. In a curriculum, a <dfn id="d-unit">Unit</dfn> is defined as a large group of learning objectives similar in mathematical content and student thinking. There is usually a unit assessment, such as a test or project, administered at the end of each unit. <dfn id="d-lesson">Lessons</dfn> further subdivide Units into more specific concepts and are accompanied by smaller quizzes. Below are links to the Unit Overviews, which contain information such as learning objectives and vocabulary for each unit.</p>

	<h1 class="h-beta"><a href="equations/index.html">Unit 2: Equations &amp; Inequalities</a></h1>
	<p class="prose">This unit focuses on finding the solutions of linear equations and inequalities with one variable. Students will model and solve equations and inequalities using a variety of representations. Students will translate verbal and mathematical equations, and will set up and solve equations to determine the solutions of real-world problems given in verbal form. Students will also graph solution sets to one-variable inequalities on a number line.</p>

	<h1 class="h-beta"><a href="proportions/index.html">Unit 3: Rational Numbers &amp; Proportions</a></h1>
	<p class="prose">In this unit, students' learning will center on proportional reasoning. Students will explore different representations of positive rational numbers, familiarize their placement with respect to each other in a total order, and make connections between magnitude and order. They will also investigate the concepts of ratio and proportion, and use these to solve practical problems involving real-world scenarios.</p>
