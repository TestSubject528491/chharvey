	<p class="prose">Grade Seven Mathematics is the standard mathematics course taken by students in their second year of secondary education. Students who successfully complete the <a class="sp" href="http://doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/mathematics/index.shtml">Grade Seven Standards of Learning</a> should prepare to study <a>Algebra I</a> in eighth grade. Students who need reinforcing of mathematical abilities before Algebra I should prepare to enroll in <a>Grade Eight Mathematics</a>.</p>

		<h1 class="h-beta">Grading Policy</h1>
		<p>Students' grades for each marking period in Mr. Harvey's class are categorized as follows:</p>
		<dl class="syll-categories">
			<dt>15%</dt>
			<dd>Benchmark Exam</dd>
			<dt>10%</dt>
			<dd>Projects</dd>
			<dt>30%</dt>
			<dd>Tests</dd>
			<dt>25%</dt>

			<dd>Homework/Classwork</dd>
		</dl>
	</header>
	<section id="cat-exam" class="cat-exam">
		<p class="prose">The Benchmark Exam is an end-of-quarter exam that tests all the material that has been covered that quarter, and serves as a predictor of how the student will perform on the end-of course test.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="cat-proj" class="cat-proj">
		<p class="prose">Projects measure students' mathematical abilities and knowledge of a general unit. Only the final product is graded, so the process (studying, preparation, etc.) is not evaluated. These grades are based on correctness and are judged by a rubric or criterion.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="cat-test" class="cat-test">
		<p class="prose">Tests measure students' performance on learning objectives mandated by the State. They are administered to show teacher and students a snapshot of their proficiency with the standards. Though tests are mostly graded on correctness, the student's progress and level of proficiency is taken into account. <strong>Test grades will indicate to the student their level of proficiency with the material.</strong></p>
		<p>Students will receive the following indicators for level of achievement on tests:</p>
		<dl class="syll-testgrades">
			<dt>V</dt>
			<dd>mastered</dd>
<!--			<dd>(100%)</dd>-->
			<dt>IV</dt>
			<dd>proficient</dd>
<!--			<dd>(90% or above)</dd>-->
			<dt>III</dt>
			<dd>partially proficient</dd>
<!--			<dd>(80% or above)</dd>-->
			<dt>II</dt>
			<dd>working towards proficiency</dd>
<!--			<dd>(70% or above)</dd>-->
			<dt>I</dt>
			<dd>unsatisfactory</dd>
<!--			<dd>(60% or above)</dd>-->
<!--			<dt>O</dt>-->
<!--			<dd>declined</dd>-->
<!--			<dd>(50%)</dd>-->
		</dl>
		<p class="prose">Students are offered an unlimited number of chances to retake tests within each quarter. The student's final test grade will result in a weighted average of the two test scores: 30% of the first test score and 70% of the retake score. If a student attempts a test multiple times, the final test grade is based on the <strong>trend</strong> of the previous attempts. Students may not retake tests from previous quarters.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="cat-quiz" class="cat-quiz">
		<p class="prose">Quizzes act as stepping-stones to tests. They are open-book and very short, measuring students' understanding of specific concepts. Notes and homework may be used during these quizzes, so students who study and practice nightly will benefit.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="cat-hw" class="cat-hw">
		<p class="prose">Homework, classwork, and in-class activities help teacher and students obtain a view of the progress they are making towards understanding a topic. They are graded only on completion and participation, assuming there is evidence of a reasonable effort. See <a href="#homework">Homework Policy</a> below.</p>

		<h1 class="h-gamma">Homework Policy</h1>
		<p class="prose">Students will be given homework on a daily basis. Homework assignments are expected to be complete by the due date, however students are permitted more time if needed. Only homework that is complete may be used for <a href="#cat-quiz">Quizzes</a>, which are open-book.</p>
		<p class="prose">Each student's homework progress will be recorded in their personal homework log, which will be kept at school. When a student receives credit for homework, Mr. Harvey will stamp the homework log for that item. Mr. Harvey will collect the homework log at the end of the unit, at which point the students' score will be entered in the grade book. Homework will not be accepted after the homework log for that unit is collected.</p>
		<p class="prose">It is the student's responsibility to keep track of his or her homework progress and make up missing homework accordingly. Parents who wish to be kept in the loop on their child's homework progress may make special arrangements with Mr. Harvey.</p>
