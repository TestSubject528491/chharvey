<section id="grading">
	<h1 class="h-beta">Grading Policy</h1>
	<p>Students' grades for each marking period in Mr. Harvey's class are categorized as follows:</p>
	<table class="table-list">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col">Category</th>
				<th scope="col">Abbreviation</th>
				<th scope="col">Weight</th>
				<th scope="col">Description</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr class="cat-exam">
				<th scope="row">Exams</th>
				<td>EXAM</td>
				<td>15%</td>
				<td><p class="prose">The Benchmark Exam is an end-of-quarter exam that tests all the material that has been covered that quarter, and serves as a predictor of how the student will perform on the end-of course test.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="cat-test">
				<th scope="row">Projects</th>
				<td>PROJ</td>
				<td>10%</td>
				<td><p class="prose">Projects test students' mathematical abilities and knowledge of a general unit. Only the final product is graded, so the process (studying, preparation, etc.) is not evaluated. These grades are based on correctness and are judged by a rubric or criterion.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="cat-std">
				<th scope="row">Tests</th>
				<td>TEST</td>
				<td>30%</td>
				<td>
					<p class="prose">Tests measure students' performance on learning objectives mandated by the State. The tests are administered to show teacher and students a snapshot of their proficiency with the standards. The tests are mostly graded on correctness, however the student's progress and level of proficiency is taken into account. Students will receive the following indicators of achievement:</p>
					<dl class="std-grades">
						<dt>V</dt>
						<dd>mastered</dd>
						<dt>IV</dt>
						<dd>proficient</dd>
						<dt>III</dt>
						<dd>partially proficient</dd>
						<dt>II</dt>
						<dd>working towards proficiency</dd>
						<dt>I</dt>
						<dd>unsatisfactory</dd>
					</dl>
					<p class="prose">Students are offered an unlimited number of chances to retake the Tests within each quarter. The student's final test grade will result in a weighted average of the two test scores: 30% of the first test score and 70% of the retake score. If a student attempts a test multiple times, the final quiz grade is based on the <strong>trend</strong> of the previous attempts. Students may not retake tests from previous quarters.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="cat-quiz">
				<th scope="row">Quizzes</th>
				<td>QUIZ</td>
				<td>25%</td>
				<td>
					<p class="prose">Quizzes act as stepping-stones to the Tests. They are open-book and very short, measuring students' understanding of specific concepts. Notes and homework may be used during these quizzes, so students who study and practice nightly will benefit.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="cat-hw">
				<th scope="row">Homework</th>
				<td>HW</td>
				<td>20%</td>
				<td>
					<p class="prose">Homework, classwork, and in-class activities help teacher and students obtain a view of the progress they are making towards understanding a topic. They are graded only on completion and participation, assuming there is evidence of a reasonable effort. See <a href="#homework">Homework Policy</a> below.</p>

		<h1 class="h-gamma">Homework Policy</h1>
		<p class="prose">Students will be given homework on a daily basis. Homework assignments are expected to be complete by the due date, however students are permitted more time if needed. Only homework that is complete may be used for the Section Quizzes, which are open-book.</p>
		<p class="prose">Each student's homework progress will be recorded in their personal homework log, which will be kept at school. When a student receives credit for homework, Mr. Harvey will stamp the homework log for that item. Mr. Harvey will collect the homework log at the end of the unit, at which point the students' score will be entered in the grade book. Homework will not be accepted after the homework log for that unit is collected.</p>
		<p class="prose">It is the student's responsibility to keep track of his or her homework progress and make up missing homework accordingly. Parents who wish to be kept in the loop on their child's homework progress may make special arrangements with Mr. Harvey.</p>
