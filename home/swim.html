<h1 class="h-folio">Swimming is my talent.</h1>
<p class="prose dropcap">Since the age of seven, I&rsquo;ve began swimming and fell in love with the sport. I even started coaching when I was eighteen. Throughout my swimming career I&rsquo;ve attended many swim camps and regional and state competitions. I love coaching and making connections between coaching, psychology, and teaching.</p>
<p class="prose">My coaching philosophy highlights four priorities: Safety, Sportsmanship, Spread, and Success. Aside from swimmers&rsquo; safety, I support friendly competition within my team and among other teams. Development is also very important during a single season, and I am proud of the many swimmers who have dropped time and gotten personal bests under my tutelage.</p>
<p hidden="">One of the most frequent duties as a coach is to construct effective workouts. A workout is an agenda of things to complete during one practice. My workouts always include a warmup, a main set, and a warmdown. The main set of a workout can take many forms, but I usually like to have an &ldquo;entr&eacute;e&rdquo; and then a few &ldquo;side dishes&rdquo; to accompany it. Another form is to have a theme for the overall main set, broken up into sections. For example, we may do the same type of thing for different strokes.</p>
