		<h1 class="H Beta">Early Life</h1>
		<p class="P">I was born and raised in the suburbs of Fairfax, VA. I attended
			<a class="Link" rel="external" href="http://www.fcps.edu/FairfaxVillaES/">Fairfax Villa
			Elementary School</a> during the First and Second Grades, then transfered to the
			<b>Gifted and Talented</b> program in <a class="Link" rel="external"
			href="http://www.fcps.edu/GreenbriarWestES/">Greenbriar West Elementary
			School</a> for Grades Three through Six. As a <abbr title="Gifted and Talented">GT</abbr>
			student, I was offered the decision to go to either Rocky Run Middle School or
			<a class="Link" rel="external" href="http://www.fcps.edu/LanierMS/">Sidney Lanier Middle School</a>. I ended up
			choosing Lanier because of the new network of computers they had. Back then, it was a
			big deal. Lanier was also closer to home.</p>
		<p class="P">I graduated from <a class="Link" rel="external"

		<h1 class="H Beta">Collegiate Career</h1>
		<p>My reasons for attending <a class="Link" rel="external"
			href="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a> were many, but these were the
			main highlights:</p>
		<ul class="List U">
			<li>I wanted to stay in-state. Tuition is much cheaper.</li>
			<li>I wanted to be close enough to home that it would be easy to commute during breaks,
				but far enough away from home to experience an independent college life.</li>
			<li>I wanted to attend a big university, not a small college.</li>
			<li>I liked the marching band program here better than any other VA university.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section id="music">
		<h1 class="H Beta">Musical Training</h1>
		<p class="P">I&rsquo;ve been playing the piano since I was seven years old. Throughout
			my childhood I had been taking lessons from one piano teacher, Mrs. Ball. In Forth Grade,
			I picked up the viola, and then switched to the trombone in Sixth Grade. I played
			trombone in the Lanier Middle School band, and in the Fairfax High School marching,
			symphonic, and jazz bands for all four years. I continued with the trombone in the
			<a class="Link" rel="external"
			href="http://marchingvirginians.music.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech Marching Virginians</a>
			for three years. I also picked up the alto saxophone and participated in the
			University Campus Band during the spring semester of my sophomore year at VT.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="math">
		<h1 class="H Beta">Mathematical Training</h1>
		<p class="P">Ever since I first learned what math was (or what I learned what I thought
			math was), I remember being interested in it. Throughout my childhood, I developed an
			interest in math at an exponential rate. In early elementary school, the
			<abbr title="Gifted and Talented">GT</abbr> program introduced mathematical concepts
			that weren&rsquo;t normally seen until later years, and in Sixth Grade I started learning
			pre-algebra. Mrs. Whitechurch was my Geometry and Algebra II teacher in high school,
			and her classes were always fun for me. She and my other high school math teachers had
			further increased my interest in the subject. I felt very close with Ms. Robbins. She
			made Trig and Precalc really fun for me and was the first teacher to introduce limits.
			That sparked my greatest interest in Calculus. I remember having such a difficult time
			with chain rule. Ms. Varanavage, my Calculus teacher, and Mr. Petersen, my Physics
			teacher, were always in battle. They were like rivals trying to be the first ones to
			teach us the same content. I actually learned anti-derivatives in Physics before I
			learned it in Calculus!</p>
		<p class="P">As a mathematician, the subjects I am most interested in are calculus and
			analysis. I passed the AP Calculus BC exam with a 5, so I didn&rsquo;t need to take
			Freshman Calculus in college. But Multi-Var with
			<a class="Link" rel="external" href="http://www.math.vt.edu/people/rosnide3/">Dr. Snider</a>,
			Vector Calc with
			<a class="Link" rel="external" href="http://www.math.vt.edu/people/jthomson/">Dr. Thompson</a>,
			and Advanced Calc with
			<a class="Link" rel="external" href="http://www.math.vt.edu/people/parrycj/">Dr. Parry</a>
			were difficult feats.</p>
