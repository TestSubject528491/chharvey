		<h1 class="h-beta">Early Life</h1>
		<p class="prose">I was born and raised in the suburbs of Fairfax, VA. I attended <a href="http://www.fcps.edu/FairfaxVillaES/">Fairfax Villa Elementary School</a> during the 1st and 2nd grades, then transfered to the <b>Gifted and Talented</b> program in <a href="http://www.fcps.edu/GreenbriarWestES/">Greenbriar West Elementary School</a> for grades 3 through 6. As a <abbr title="Gifted and Talented">GT</abbr> student, I was offered the decision to go to either Rocky Run Middle School or <a href="http://www.fcps.edu/LanierMS/">Sidney Lanier Middle School</a>. I ended up choosing Lanier because of the new network of computers they had. Back then, it was a big deal. Lanier was also closer to home.</p>
		<p class="prose h-delta">I graduated from <a href="http://www.fcps.edu/FairfaxHS/">Fairfax High School</a> in <time datetime="2006-06-15">June, 2006</time>.</p>

		<h1 class="h-beta">Collegiate Career</h1>
		<p>My choices for attending <a href="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a> were many, but the main highlights were:</p>
		<ul class="list-text">
			<li>I wanted to stay in-state. Tuition is much cheaper.</li>
			<li>I wanted to be close enough to home that it would be easy to commute during breaks, but far enough away from home to experience an independent college life.</li>
			<li>I wanted to attend a big university, not a small college.</li>
			<li>I liked the marching band program here better than any other VA university.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 class="h-beta">Musical Training</h1>
		<p class="prose">I've been playing the piano since I was seven years old. Throughout my childhood I had been taking lessons from one piano teacher, Mrs. Ball. In 4th grade, I picked up the viola, and then switched to the trombone in 6th grade. I played trombone in the Lanier Middle School band, and in the Fairfax High School marching, symphonic, and jazz bands for all four years. I continued with the trombone in the Virginia Tech Marching Virginians for three years. I also picked up the alto saxophone and participated in the University Campus Band during the spring semester of my sophomore year at VT.</p>

		<h1 class="h-beta">Mathematical Training</h1>
		<p class="prose">Ever since I first learned what math was (or what I learned what I thought math was), I remember being interested in it. Throughout my childhood, I developed an interest in math at an exponential rate. In early elementary school, the <abbr title="Gifted and Talented">GT</abbr> program introduced mathematical concepts that weren't normally seen until later years, and in 6th grade I started learning pre-algebra. Mrs. Whitechurch was my Geometry and Algebra II teacher in high school, and her classes were always fun for me. She and my other high school math teachers had further increased my interest in the subject. I felt very close with Ms. Robbins. She made Trig and Precalc really fun for me and was the first teacher to introduce limits. That sparked my greatest interest in Calculus. I remember having such a difficult time with chain rule. Ms. Varanavage, my Calculus teacher, and Mr. Petersen, my Physics teacher, were always in battle. They were like rivals trying to be the first ones to teach us the same content. I actually learned anti-derivatives in Physics before I learned it in Calculus!</p>
		<p class="prose">As a math student, the subjects I am most interested in are calculus and analysis. I passed the AP Calculus BC exam with a 5, so I didn't need to freshman Calculus in college. But Multi-Var with <a href="http://www.math.vt.edu/people/rosnide3/">Dr. Snider</a>, Vector Calc with <a href="http://www.math.vt.edu/people/jthomson/">Dr. Thompson</a>, and Advanced Calc with <a href="http://www.math.vt.edu/people/parrycj/">Dr. Parry</a> were difficult feats.</p>
