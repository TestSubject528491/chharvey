## topic: set theory ##

(prove using “=” relation) for all x in S, if there exists a y such that x = y, then y is in S.

## topic: metric spaces ##

definition: delta-neighborhood: Given a metric M, and a distance delta, and an element x in M, the delta-neighborhood of x, V, is the set of all t in M such that d(x,t) < delta.

Definition of "density": a metric M is "dense" if and only if for every x in M, and for every distance delta, there exists a t in M such that t is in the delta-neighborhood of x.

Another definition of density: Given a metric M, M is dense if and only if for every two elements x and y in M, there exists another element t such that x <= t <= y. Is this equivalent to the first definition?

reconcile definitions of “neighborhood” (of a metric space M)
1. a set V is a neighborhood around x iff it contains the set of all points t in M such that d(x,t) < delta, given some distance delta.
2. a set V is a neighborhood of x iff there exists an ‘open set’ S of x such that S is a subset of V, where “open set” is defined as:
	A set U is "open" iff for every point y in U, there exists a set {z in U : d(y,z) < epsilon} for some real number epsilon

Attempt:

Given a metric space M, given a point x in M and a real-valued distance delta, a set V is a “delta-neighborhood” around x iff V is the set of all t in M such that d(x,t) < delta.

Given a metric space M, a point x in M, and a real distance delta, a delta-neighborhood around x exists. WFF: (forall R)({R is the set of real numbers})(forall M)({m is a metric space})(forall x in M)(forall delta in R) (exists V)(forall t)(t in V iff (t in M implies {d(x,t) < delta})) Proof: subset axiom schema replacing (s in M implies {d(x,s) < delta}) with P(s).

A set U is “open” iff for every point y in U, U contains some delta-neighborhood of y.
