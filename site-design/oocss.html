<h1 class="H Alpha">Object-Oriented CSS</h1>
<p class="prose">This document describes guidelines for writing good <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/" rel="external">CSS</a> with a true object-oriented programming (<abbr>OOP</abbr>) point of view. For more information, read up on <a href="http://lesscss.org" rel="external">Less CSS</a>, <a>Sass</a>, and <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss">Nicole Sullivan's <abbr title="object-oriented cascading style sheets">OOCSS</abbr> open-source project</a>.</p>
This is all gonna go in a spec somewhere...
- [ ] 2014-03-30 instead of using classes (`span.hsub`, etc.) for QUASI-ELEMENTS, use the `data-*`
	attribute. For example, `<span data-qe="subh">`. Then style these with `[data-qe="subh"]`. The
	selector is equally as specific as `.subh` but may be less efficient; though this is a minor
	cost to pay for semantic benefit.
- [ ] 2014-04-01 separate pure-style classes (e.g. `.list-basic`, `.dl-table-sml`, `.table-list`,
	etc.) from semantic classes (e.g. `.dl-ordered`, `.hsub`, `.postal`, etc.). Maybe use the HTML
	`data-*` attribute?

	<h1>Rules</h1>
	<p>OOCSS classes must only implement interfaces that have been previously defined in a stylesheet. The reason is to honor the Cascade. If a class were to extend a class that were defined <em>afterward</em>, then some of the properties in the subclass may get overridden by properties in the superclass.</p>
	<p>OOCSS classes must only include mixins that have been previously defined in a styesheet. The reason is to prevent infinite loops (or in set theory terms, irregular sets). If .bar includes .foo and .foo includes class .bar, the Less will not compile. Thus if .foo is written before .bar, then .bar may extend .foo but .foo may not include .bar.</p>
	<p>However, any class may include any mixin, regardless of where the mixin was defined. Keep in mind that the order of mixin declarations in a class's style block will affect the order of styles that apply on compilation. Mixins should be "called" in the order they were defined in the stylesheet.</p>
