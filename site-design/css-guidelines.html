<section id="cascade">
	<h1 class="h--beta">Honor the Cascade</h1>
	<p>The &ldquo;C&rdquo; in CSS stands for &ldquo;Cascading.&rdquo; There are two aspects of the way that stylesheets Cascade: one, and most obviously, some properties of elements are inherited from their parent elements (&ldquo;parent&rdquo; here referring to the container in the DOM tree). These properties trickle down the tree, getting applied to each child unless it is overriden by that child's property. This has nothing to do with specificity; this has only to do with the fact that elements' properties override the inherited properties of their parents.</p>
	<p>The second aspect of the Cascade is where the true beauty of CSS can be appreciated. In terms of <a>selector specificity</a>, more specific properties override less specific ones. This means that the least specific properties (those that apply to element selectors) get applied first, followed by class selectors, followed by combinator selectors, and so on. The order these selectors are defined doesn't matter: their specificity will take precidence. However, in the case that two selectors have the same specificity, the styles will cascade from top to bottom, so the latter selector's property will override the former's. It is for this reason that we want to define our properties, selectors, and stylsheets in order of increasing specificity.</p>
	<section id="property-order">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Property Order</h1>
		<p class="prose">Within a block, the properties must be written in order of decreasing structure definition. See the figure below for an illustration.</p>

		<h1 class="h--gamma">Selector Order</h1>
		<p class="prose">This section does not discuss <a>how authors should organize their stylesheets</a>, but the order selectors should be written within a group of selectors.</p>
		<p class="prose">In general, selectors within a group of style blocks should be written in order of increasing specificity. This means elements first, then classes, then qualifiers/modifiers (pseudo-), and combinators last. The order of qualifiers is not too important, but the order of combinators is. This is because multiple selectors may have the same specificity when an author's belief might be that they do not.</p>
		<p class="success">The example below uses metasyntactic variables for illustration purposes. See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt">RFC 3902</a> for more information.</p>
		<p class="prose">The adjacent sibling of an element <em>is</em> a general sibling, but it is a &ldquo;specific&rdquo; type of sibling, namely, an adjacent one. Therefore it is a common misconception that the selector <code>.foo + .bar {}</code> has a higher <a>specificity</a> than <code>.foo ~ .bar {}</code>, and thus the former will override the latter (regardless of the order in which they are defined). After all, wouldn't you think that a <code>.foo + .bar {}</code> <em>is</em> a <code>.foo ~ .bar {}</code>? However, these two selectors actually have equivalent <a>specificity</a>, so whichever one is written last in the stylesheet will take precidence. The bottom line is that authors must define <code>.foo ~ .bar {}</code> <em>before</em> <code>.foo + .bar {}</code> in the stylesheet in order to get the results they expect. The same method applies to <code>.baz .qux {}</code> and <code>.baz > .qux {}</code>: the former must be defined before the latter.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="stylesheet-order">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Stylesheet Order</h1>
		<p>Stylesheets should be imported in order from least specifying to most specifying. It is recommended to split stylesheets into the following categories:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>base stylesheet, including global variables and mixins</li>
			<li>reset stylesheet with element selectors only</li>
			<li>layout stylesheets such as grids and vertical rhythm systems</li>
			<li>typography (headings, paragraphs, etc.)</li>
			<li>modules (abstract objects like buttons, breadcrumbs)</li>
			<li>style trumps (states, anomalies, etc.)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>A <dfn>base stylesheet</dfn> contains all your global (site-wide) variables, mixins, and utility patterns used throughout the site. Since this file is imported first, every other CSS (or Less) file has access to it.</p>
		<p>A <dfn>reset stylesheet</dfn> removes all styles, e.g. gets rid of all margins, padding, bold, italics, etc. It strips the elements down to nothing. The use of a CSS-Reset is controversial. Authors against the use of a reset would say there's no point in removing a margin if you're going to add it back in later; this is just more work for the browser. Proponents might say that there's no predicting how a browser might one day change the default presentation of an element (all of a sudden it might decide to just go ahead and italicize all paragraphs), so you might as well reset everything just in case.</p>
		<p>It's best to use a mix of both philosophies. This means resetting things that need to be reset, such as margin and padding if you are implementing a <a>vertical rhythm system</a>, and other browser-specific resets (such as non-HTML5-compliant browsers), but leaving other things alone that don't need to be reset, such as font weight and font style. This process can be done on an element-by-element basis, which may take long to write. The properties that are left alone can always be defined in particular elements or classes, later on in more targeted stylesheets (such as typography or modules). The reset stylesheet should be very broad and general, because it comes early in the Cascade and is likely to be overridden later.</p>
		<p>The <dfn>layout stylesheet(s)</dfn> will define the <a>grid system</a> and/or <a>vertical rhythm system</a> of the site. These stylesheets will define only Classes that are meant for containers, not content. Thus it is acceptable that these classnames be presentational.</p>
		<p>The <dfn>typography stylesheet</dfn> defines Classes for typographical content including headings, paragraphs, block quotes, lists, figures, tables, and text-level semantics (highlighting, etc.). Some authors choose to split even these categories into separate stylesheets. This stylesheet does not use element selectors as you would expect, but rather conceptual Classes that correspond to elements of a document. The <a>HTML elements must instantiate the CSS Classes</a> for proper styling. Elements that do not instantiate a Class will be styled via <a>Reset</a> or browser-default.</p>

	<h1 class="h--beta">Stylesheet Anatomy</h1>
	<p class="prose">While the in the last sections we discussed how to format specific syntaxes, this section focuses more on the stylesheet structure itself.</p>
	<section id="filename">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">File Name</h1>
		<p class="prose">At the top of every stylesheet after imports and other such directives, the filename must be indicated as so:</p>

			</code>
		</figure>
		<p class="prose">The filename must be indented with 4 spaces (not 1 tab, even if the tab size is set to 4). Notice the lines above and below the filename contain hyphens (<code>-</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/002d/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+002D</code></a>), extending 2 to the left and 2 to the right of the filename. This comment uses the block comment notation (<code>/* &hellip; */</code>) so that it gets compiled into the CSS files. Besides the filename, <a href="#headings">heading names</a> and <a href="#comments">Doc Blocks</a> will be block comments as well. All other comments must be inline (<code>// &hellip; </code>).</p>
	</section>
	<section id="toc">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Table of Contents</h1>
		<p class="prose">After the filename, include a table of contents in inline comments. Each line on the table of contents represents a heading and is written as a <code>ul</code> in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" rel="external">Markdown format</a>. Each stylesheet must only have 2 levels of headings: <b class="keyword">top-level</b> and <b class="keyword">low-level</b>. (Any deeper levels will make the stylesheet too complex; if this is the case, the author is suggested to break up the file into multiple files.) The top-level headings must be in all-caps, and the low-level headings must be first cap only. The table of contents must be preceed by a blank line. Below is an example.</p>
		<figure>
			<code class="code--block">

		<h1 class="h--gamma">Classname Semantics</h1>
		<p>OOCSS classes must only extend classes that have been previously defined in a stylesheet. The reason is to honor the Cascade. If a class were to extend a class that were defined <em>afterward</em>, then some of the properties in the subclass may get overridden by properties in the superclass.</p>
		<p>OOCSS classes must only include classes that have been previously defined in a styesheet. The reason is to prevent infinite loops (or in set theory terms, irregular sets). If class .bar includes class .foo and class .foo includes class .bar, the Less will not compile. Thus if .foo is written before .bar, then .bar may extend .foo but .foo may not include .bar.</p>
		<p>However, any class may include any mixin, regardless of where the mixin was defined. Keep in mind that the order of mixin declarations in a class's style block will affect the order of styles that apply on compilation. Mixins should be "called" in the order they were defined in the stylesheet.</p>
		<p class="prose"><span class="lede-sent">The original intent of HTML classes.</span> Classes were <a>originally</a> meant to group <strong>semantically similar</strong> elements together. For example, all elements that represent warnings on a page could be instances of the <code>.warning</code> class. A side effect of similar elements belonging to one class is that they can all be styled the same way with CSS.</p>
		<p class="prose">Now with the development of <a>Object-Oriented CSS</a>, we have learned to take advantage of classes and use them for many different reasons. Such a diverse use of one specific feature of HTML has grown so large it has become an epidemic.</p>
		<p class="prose"><span class="lede-sent">&ldquo;Classes&rdquo; of Classes.</span> There is a clear case of <a>&ldquo;classitis&rdquo;</a> in the Web-developing world. Before you object, my definition of classitis refers not to the overuse of classes&mdash;there can never be too many classes present in an HTML document&mdash;but to the fact that we are using classes for <em>everything</em>. We need to seriously look at how and why we are using classes, what kinds of &ldquo;classifications&rdquo; into which we can organize them, and maybe provide some alternative methods and/or conventions for implementing semantics and style.</p>
		<p class="prose">The following sections describe different ways classes are being used in CSS.</p>
		<section>
			<h1 class="h--delta">Presentational</h1>
			<p class="prose">Presentational classnames describe the properties of the class. Examples include <code>.big</code>, <code>.margin-top-24</code>, <code>.list-inline</code>, and <code>.grid-50-left</code>.</p>
			<p class="prose">There are some cases in which having these classes available in CSS is helpful. In short, they provide abstraction. Classes such as <code>.margin-top-24</code> and <code>.list-inline</code> can be used as a mechanism for consistency, and can save developers the hassle of having to repeat the same lines of code over and over again. For example, redefining the same top margin on multiple elements is not only tedius but also error prone. The developer has to remember the number of pixels, code is repeated, and upkeep is expensive. These classes provide an easy and scalable solution. Another case of this is using a <a href="grid.html">grid system</a>. A class such as <code>.grid-50-left</code> is <em>very</em> presentational but necessary for <abbr title="don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> code.</p>
			<p class="prose">There are two types of presentational classes: classes that are used to abstract repeating patterns, such as <code>.margin-top-24</code>, and classes that represent physical objects like <code>.grid-50-left</code>. Though these types are tehnically indistinguishable&mdash;they have a given set of properties just like any CSS class&mdash;they are used for different purposes. We must make the distinction clear to provide a starting point for the cure of classitis. The former type, so-called &ldquo;utility classes,&rdquo; don't really represent Objects in the sense of Object-Oriented programming. They're just a collection of properties that are used many times within a site. The latter type, we'll call &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; We will see in a minute </p>
			<p class="prose">Presentational classes should <em>not</em> be accessible to the HTML. There are a number of reasons:</p>
			<ol class="prose">
				<li><span class="lede-sent">HTML describes content, not presentation.</span> Technically, classes are in the HTML. Adding class <code>.boldred</code> to an <code>small</code> element does not add any semantic value to the text. An ideal alternative would be to use <code>small.warning</code> (or something similar) and then have the <code>.warning</code> class extend <code>.boldred</code> in some way.</li>
				<li><span class="lede-sent">The Theoretical Redesign Future.</span> If you wanted to change the properties of the <code>.boldred</code> class, say, make it italic instead of bold, now you have to deal with an awkward classname, or you have to change the classname everywhere in the HTML.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="prose">There are a few solutions to this usage. The first solution is to use a mixin. A mixin allows the developer to reuse lines of code without having to write them over and over again. It's basically a glorified copy-and-paste. Mixins are available in CSS pre-processors such as Less and Sass, and using a mixin instead of a class will hide the <del>classname</del> <ins>mixin name</ins> from the CSS output. That means the name can't be used in HTML, which is good.</p>
			<p class="prose">The problem with mixins is that although they make life easier for the developer, the compiled CSS is still not DRY. The properties are still being written over and over again (this time by the compiler), which means a lot of work for the browser, a lot of bytes to download, etc.</p>
			<p class="prose">A better solution is to still use a class, but &ldquo;hide&rsquo; it from the HTML by nesting it into a nonsensical ID selector. For example, in your CSS (or Less), define <code>#_&nbsp;&nbsp;.boldred {&hellip;}</code> and extend it with the classes you need such as <code>.warning</code>. Yes, the class <code>.boldred</code> is still available to the HTML, but the styles will only apply if it's in an element with <code>id=&quot;_&quot;</code>, which I hope you'd never use. By the way, this is the one time you can use an ID selector. (And it's really not even an ID selector.) </p>

		<section>
			<h1 class="h--delta">Semantic</h1>
			<p class="prose">Semantic classnames describe the meaning of the component and/or its contents. Examples include <code>.pacingtable</code>, <code>.answer</code>, <code>.optional</code>, and <code>.success</code>.</p>
			<p class="prose">These are good classes to have because they mark up HTML elements with data describing what they mean. For example, take the element <code>p.success</code>. There are two semantic things going on here: first, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag describes what the element <em>is</em> (a paragraph), but second, the <code>&quot;success&quot;</code> class describes what the element <em>means</em>: it is some sort of indication of success, such as the completion of an upload. In a way, the classname has more semantic value than the element name itself!</p>

	<section id="classname-syntax">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Classname Syntax</h1>
		<p class="prose">Classnames must consist of either lowercase letters of the English alphabet (<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0061/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+0061</code></a>&ndash;<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/007a/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+007A</code></a>), hyphens (<code>-</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/002d/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+002D</code></a>), or underscores (<code>_</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/005f/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+005F</code></a>).</p>
		<p class="prose">Major words in a classname must appear in order from general to specific, and separated by one hyphen. Minor words should be combined, not separated. &ldquo;Major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor&rdquo; are not standardized; they are left to the author's discretion. Examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>.lede-para</code></li>
			<li><code>.lede-sent</code></li>
			<li><code>.dropcap</code></li>
			<li><code>.rowgroup</code></li>
		</ul>
		<section id="namespace">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Namespace Prefixes</h1>
			<p class="prose">Classnames used only on one page or in a group of pages (e.g., a sub-site) must begin with a namespace prefix. This will help keep styles separated and prevent overuse of classnames. The namespace must contain only lowercase letters and should be less than 6 characters. The namespace must be followed by an underscore.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>.res_skillgroup</code></li>
				<li><code>.scheme_colortable</code></li>
				<li><code>.grid_phidemo</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="prose">Chances are, you will need to add classes to your HTML elements so JavaScript can grab them and do things to them. We call these classes <dfn>JS hooks</dfn>. <strong>Never use CSS styling classes for JS hooks.</strong> Use the <code>.js_</code> namespace prefix, and don't apply any styles to these classes.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>.js_table</code></li>
				<li><code>.js_expando</code></li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="extensions">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Extensions</h1>
			<p class="prose">Some classes will need modifiers for sizing, etc. In the name of object-oriented programming, let's call these classes &ldquo;extensions.&rdquo; For instance, let's say you want to have a class <code>.foo</code> that extends a class <code>.bar</code>. That is, <code>.foo</code> has all the properties that <code>.bar</code> has, and possibly then some. Use a double-hyphen to separate a classname with its modifier. Our extension would then be called <code>.bar--foo</code>. If a classname such as <code class="lang-css">.bar--foo</code> exists, it is assumed that a classname <code class="lang-css">.bar</code> exists, which is the parent class. Classes may have nested extensions, that is, extensions of extensions. In object-oriented language, these would be called class descendants.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>.box--inline</code></li>
				<li><code>.h--alpha</code></li>
				<li><code>.list--bare</code></li>
				<li><code>.list--inline--c</code></li>
				<li><code>.dl--table--sml</code></li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="descendants">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Descendants</h1>
			<p class="prose draft"><em>Class</em> inheritance/descendants are different than <em>object</em> inheritance/descendants. A class child, or an extension, of a class is a class that inherits all the properties of its parent. On the other hand, a component child of an object is literally an object within an object (for example, a <code>p</code> within a <code>section</code>). Some properties such as <code>color</code> and <code>font-weight</code> are inherited through object inheritance, but other properties such as <code>border</code> are not.</p>
			<p class="prose">With <a href="#descendant-selectors">some exceptions</a>, descendant selectors are usually avoided, so indicating that one class of HTML element belongs as a descendent of another class of element is <a>not specified via selector</a>: it is usually specified in some sort of documentation. However it is advantageous to additionaly <strong>indicate so in the classname</strong> for extra unambiguity, without sacrificing specificity or efficiency. This way, the developer knows that the element belongs inside the other by inspection.</p>
			<p class="prose">In the name of a class that is a descendant of another class, the &ldquo;parent classname&rdquo; and &ldquo;child classname&rdquo; are separated by two underscores. This similar to the practice of using one underscore to indicate namespaces. (In a way, the child classname is in the parent classname namespace.) If a child classname such as <code>.bar__foo</code> exists, it is assumed that a classname <code>.bar</code> exists.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>.bc__anc</code></li>
				<li><code>.fnotes__fn</code></li>
				<li><code>.lang--html__tag</code></li>

<section id="selectors" class="draft">
	<h1 class="h--beta">Guidelines for Writing Selectors</h1>
	<p class="prose">Each selector has a <a>specificity</a> and an <a>efficiency</a>. I won't talk about them too much here, but generally the more efficient a selector is, the more specific it gets, and vice versa: less specific selectors are usually not that efficient. Our goal is to find the right balance between keeping our selectors low in specificity while high in efficiency.</p>
	<p class="prose">The majority of the selectors in a stylesheet should be single classes only. Class selectors are the most efficient way for browsers to style pages, <a>not counting IDs</a>. For the most part, use single class selectors.</p>
	<p class="prose"><span class="lede-sent">Content before presentation.</span> There are exceptions to the &ldquo;single-class&rdquo; rule. When it comes down to efficient HTML versus efficient CSS, HTML wins. The reason? Semantics always trumps style. You've got a problem when you find yourself having to adjust a huge amount of HTML just to conform to CSS best practices (such as adding 8 different classes to an element to get it to look exactly how you want). It should be the other way around. CSS should conform to how HTML is (or should be) written, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of efficiency.</p>
	<section id="descendant-selectors">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Child and Descendant Selectors</h1>
		<p class="prose"><a href="#subcomponents">As stated above</a>, it is best practice to avoid child selectors (<code>.parent &gt; .child</code>) and descendant selectors (<code>.ancestor .descendant</code>). However there are some cases in which this is okay, and these cases involve intrinsic ownership: elements that belong to other elements by HTML standards.</p>
		<section id="lists">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Lists</h1>
			<p class="prose">The following CSS is <em>very</em> efficient and not very specific at all. This is normally very good coding:</p>
			<code class="code--block">
<span class="code__sel">.nav {<span class="code__prop">&hellip;</span>}</span>
<span class="code__sel">.nav__link {<span class="code__prop">&hellip;</span>}</span>
			</code>
			<code class="code--block">
<span class="code__tag">&lt;ol <span class="code__attr">class=&quot;<span class="code__val">nav</span>&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
	<span class="code__tag">&lt;li <span class="code__attr">class=&quot;<span class="code__val">nav__link</span>&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;a&gt;</span>link 1<span class="code__tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
	<span class="code__tag">&lt;li <span class="code__attr">class=&quot;<span class="code__val">nav__link</span>&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;a&gt;</span>link 2<span class="code__tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="code__tag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
			</code>
			<p class="prose">While this is usually best practice, the issue here is that each list item requires the class <code>.nav__link</code>, and that every time an item gets added to the list, the class has to be added again. While this may be efficient CSS, this is very <em>inefficient</em> HTML and it's not very <abbr title="don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr>. For instance, if the list item classname were to change in the <a>Theoretical Redesign Future&trade;</a>, we would have to go back and change all the classes on each list item in the HTML.</p>
			<p class="prose">In this case it is better to view the list as one component, with the list items as subcomponents of that component. Here we are using a class selector to target the <code>ol</code>, but we are permitted to use an element selector to target the <code>li</code>s inside. Yes, the selector <code>.nav &gt; li</code> is more specific than <code>.nav__link</code>, but that is a small price to pay for more efficient HTML.</p>
			<code class="code--block">
<span class="code__sel">.nav {<span class="code__prop">&hellip;</span>}</span>
<span class="code__sel">nav &gt; li {<span class="code__prop">&hellip;</span>}</span>
