<section id="stylesheet-structure">
	<h1 class="h--beta">Elements of a Stylesheet</h1>
	<section id="filename">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">File Name</h1>
		<p class="prose">At the top of every stylesheet after imports and other such directives, the filename must be indicated as so:</p>
		<code class="code--block"><span class="code__comm" style="display: block;">
/*--------------*\
    reset.less
\*--------------*/
		</span></code>
		<p class="prose">The filename must be indented once. Notice the lines above and below the filename contain 2 hyphens to the left and right of the filename. This comment has the <code>/* */</code> notation so that it gets compiled into the CSS files. The filename and heading names will use this notation. All other comments must use the <code>//</code> notation.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="toc">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Table of Contents</h1>
		<p class="prose">After the filename, include a table of contents. Each line on the table of contents represents a group and is written as a <code>ul</code> in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" rel="external">Markdown</a> format. Each stylesheet must only have 2 levels of groups: <b class="keyword">top-level</b> and <b class="keyword">low-level</b>. The top-level headings must be in all-caps, and the low-level headings must be first cap only. The table of contents must be preceed by a blank line. Below is an example.</p>
		<code class="code--block">
<span class="code__comm">//Table of Contents
//- HORIZONTAL GRID
//	- Widths
//	- Golden widths and margins
//	- Lines and units
//	- Automated box widths
//	- Undo golden widths and margins
//- VERTICAL GRID
//	- Font size and line height
//	- Padding, margin, border</span>

	<section id="headings">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Group Headings</h1>
		<section id="sections-top-level">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Top-Level</h1>
			<p class="prose">Top-level group headings be preceeded by 2 blank lines and must appear as so:</p>
			<code class="code--block"><span class="code__comm">
//++++++++++++++++//
/*@HORIZONTAL GRID*/
//++++++++++++++++//
			</span></code>
			<p class="prose">The heading name must be in all caps, proceded by the at-sign (<code>@</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0040/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+0040</code></a>), and enclosed in a block comment (<code>/* */</code>). The at-sign makes it easy to <abbr title="find"><kbd>&#x2318;-F</kbd></abbr> the section headings. Notice the lines above and below have a number of plus signs (<code>+</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/002b/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+002B</code></a>) that extend out to the end of the heading name, but are inline comments (<code>//</code>). The ending slashes are for stylistic purposes. Using this notation will compile the heading name, but not the surrounding plusses, into the CSS file.</p>
			<p class="prose">At the end of the top-level section, include the following:</p>
			<code class="code--block"><span class="code__comm">
//++++ @end HORIZONTAL GRID ++++//
			</span></code>
			<p class="prose">The end of the section doesn't need to be a block comment because it is typically followed by the start of the next section. Notice the four plus signs before and after the heading name. Again, the last two slashes are just for looks.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sections-low-level">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Low-Level</h1>
			<p class="prose">Low-level group headings must be preceded by 1 blank line and must appear as so:</p>
			<code class="code--block"><span class="code__comm">
//-------//
/*@Widths*/
//-------//
			</span></code>
			<p class="prose">The heading name must be first-cap only, (unless there are any proper nouns in the heading), and also preceded by the at-sign. Notice the lines above and below have a number of hyphens (<code>-</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/002d/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+002D</code></a>) that extend out to the end of the heading name.</p>
			<p class="prose">At the end of the low-level section, include the following:</p>
			<code class="code--block"><span class="code__comm">
//---- @end Widths ----//

The opening brace must follow the last selector after a space, on the same line. The closing brace must be on its own line after the style declarations in the block.</p>
		<p class="prose">Each style declaration must be indented once, and must also appear on its own line. The colon (<code>:</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/003a/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+003A</code></a>) between the property and value must <em>not</em> be preceded by, but must be followed by, <strong>at least one</strong> space (<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0020/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+0020</code></a>). The number of spaces may be increased to vertically align values of similar properties. Each value, including the last in the block, must be followed by a semicolon (<code>;</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/003b/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+003B</code></a>).</p>
		<p class="prose">&ldquo;Javadoc&rdquo; (but CSS version) documentation must appear <em>inside</em> the style block, after the opening bracket, on its own line.

	<h1 class="h--beta">Guidelines for Naming Classes</h1>
	<section id="classname-semantics">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Classname Semantics</h1>
		<p class="prose"><span class="lede-sent">The original intent of HTML classes.</span> Classes were <a>originally</a> meant to group <strong>semantically similar</strong> elements together. For example, all elements that represent warnings on a page could be instances of the <code>.warning</code> class. A side effect of similar elements belonging to one class is that they can all be styled the same way with CSS.</p>
		<p class="prose">Now with the development of <a>Object-Oriented CSS</a>, we have learned to take advantage of classes and use them for many different reasons. Such a diverse use of one specific feature of HTML has grown so large it has become an epidemic.</p>
		<p class="prose"><span class="lede-sent">&ldquo;Classes&rdquo; of Classes.</span> There is a clear case of <a>&ldquo;classitis&rdquo;</a> in the Web-developing world. Before you object, my definition of classitis refers not to the overuse of classes&mdash;there can never be too many classes present in an HTML document&mdash;but to the fact that we are using classes for <em>everything</em>. We need to seriously look at how and why we are using classes, what kinds of &ldquo;classifications&rdquo; into which we can organize them, and maybe provide some alternative methods and/or conventions for implementing semantics and style.</p>
		<p class="prose">The following sections describe different ways classes are being used in CSS.</p>
		<section>
			<h1 class="h--delta">Presentational</h1>
			<p class="prose">Presentational classnames describe the properties of the class. Examples include <code>.big</code>, <code>.margin-top-24</code>, <code>.list-inline</code>, and <code>.grid-50-left</code>.</p>
			<p class="prose">There are some cases in which having these classes available in CSS is helpful. In short, they provide abstraction. Classes such as <code>.margin-top-24</code> and <code>.list-inline</code> can be used as a mechanism for consistency, and can save developers the hassle of having to repeat the same lines of code over and over again. For example, redefining the same top margin on multiple elements is not only tedius but also error prone. The developer has to remember the number of pixels, code is repeated, and upkeep is expensive. These classes provide an easy and scalable solution. Another case of this is using a <a href="grid.html">grid system</a>. A class such as <code>.grid-50-left</code> is <em>very</em> presentational but necessary for <abbr title="don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> code.</p>
			<p class="prose">There are two types of presentational classes: classes that are used to abstract repeating patterns, such as <code>.margin-top-24</code>, and classes that represent physical objects like <code>.grid-50-left</code>. Though these types are tehnically indistinguishable&mdash;they have a given set of properties just like any CSS class&mdash;they are used for different purposes. We must make the distinction clear to provide a starting point for the cure of classitis. The former type, so-called &ldquo;utility classes,&rdquo; don't really represent Objects in the sense of Object-Oriented programming. They're just a collection of properties that are used many times within a site. The latter type, we'll call &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; We will see in a minute </p>
			<p class="prose">Presentational classes should <em>not</em> be accessible to the HTML. There are a number of reasons:</p>
			<ol class="prose">
				<li><span class="lede-sent">HTML describes content, not presentation.</span> Technically, classes are in the HTML. Adding class <code>.boldred</code> to an <code>small</code> element does not add any semantic value to the text. An ideal alternative would be to use <code>small.warning</code> (or something similar) and then have the <code>.warning</code> class extend <code>.boldred</code> in some way.</li>
				<li><span class="lede-sent">The Theoretical Redesign Future.</span> If you wanted to change the properties of the <code>.boldred</code> class, say, make it italic instead of bold, now you have to deal with an awkward classname, or you have to change the classname everywhere in the HTML.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="prose">There are a few solutions to this usage. The first solution is to use a mixin. A mixin allows the developer to reuse lines of code without having to write them over and over again. It's basically a glorified copy-and-paste. Mixins are available in CSS pre-processors such as Less and Sass, and using a mixin instead of a class will hide the <del>classname</del> <ins>mixin name</ins> from the CSS output. That means the name can't be used in HTML, which is good.</p>
			<p class="prose">The problem with mixins is that although they make life easier for the developer, the compiled CSS is still not DRY. The properties are still being written over and over again (this time by the compiler), which means a lot of work for the browser, a lot of bytes to download, etc.</p>
			<p class="prose">A better solution is to still use a class, but &ldquo;hide&rsquo; it from the HTML by nesting it into a nonsensical ID selector. For example, in your CSS (or Less), define <code>#_&nbsp;&nbsp;.boldred {&hellip;}</code> and extend it with the classes you need such as <code>.warning</code>. Yes, the class <code>.boldred</code> is still available to the HTML, but the styles will only apply if it's in an element with <code>id=&quot;_&quot;</code>, which I hope you'd never use. By the way, this is the one time you can use an ID selector. (And it's really not even an ID selector.) </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1 class="h--delta">Semantic</h1>
			<p class="prose">Semantic classnames describe the meaning of the component and/or its contents. Examples include <code>.pacingtable</code>, <code>.answer</code>, <code>.optional</code>, and <code>.success</code>.</p>
			<p class="prose">These are good classes to have because they mark up HTML elements with data describing what they mean. For example, take the element <code>p.success</code>. There are two semantic things going on here: first, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag describes what the element <em>is</em> (a paragraph), but second, the <code>&quot;success&quot;</code> class describes what the element <em>means</em>: it is some sort of indication of success, such as the completion of an upload. In a way, the classname has more semantic value than the element name itself!</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section id="classname-syntax">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Classname Syntax</h1>
		<p class="prose">Classnames must consist of either lowercase letters of the English alphabet (<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0061/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+0061</code></a>&ndash;<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/007a/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+007A</code></a>), hyphens (<code>-</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/002d/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+002D</code></a>), or underscores (<code>_</code> <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/005f/index.htm" rel="external"><code>U+005F</code></a>).</p>
		<p class="prose">Major words in a classname must appear in order from general to specific, and separated by one hyphen. Minor words should be combined, not separated. &ldquo;Major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor&rdquo; are not standardized; they are left to the author's discretion. Examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>.lede-para</code></li>
			<li><code>.lede-sent</code></li>
			<li><code>.dropcap</code></li>
			<li><code>.rowgroup</code></li>
		</ul>
		<section id="namespace">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Namespace Prefixes</h1>
			<p class="prose">Classnames used only on one page or in a group of pages (e.g., a sub-site) must begin with a namespace prefix. This will help keep styles separated and prevent overuse of classnames. The namespace must contain only lowercase letters and should be less than 6 characters. The namespace must be followed by an underscore.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>.res_skillgroup</code></li>
				<li><code>.scheme_colortable</code></li>
				<li><code>.grid_phidemo</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="prose">Chances are, you will need to add classes to your HTML elements so JavaScript can grab them and do things to them. We call these classes <dfn>JS hooks</dfn>. <strong>Never use CSS styling classes for JS hooks.</strong> Use the <code>.js_</code> namespace prefix, and don't apply any styles to these classes.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>.js_table</code></li>
				<li><code>.js_expando</code></li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="extensions">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Extensions</h1>
			<p class="prose">Some classes will need modifiers for sizing, etc. In the name of object-oriented programming, let's call these classes &ldquo;extensions.&rdquo; For instance, let's say you want to have a class <code>.foo</code> that extends a class <code>.bar</code>. That is, <code>.foo</code> has all the properties that <code>.bar</code> has, and possibly then some. Use a double-hyphen to separate a classname with its modifier. Our extension would then be called <code>.bar--foo</code>. If a classname such as <code class="lang-css">.bar--foo</code> exists, it is assumed that a classname <code class="lang-css">.bar</code> exists, which is the parent class. Classes may have nested extensions, that is, extensions of extensions. In object-oriented language, these would be called class descendants.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>.box--inline</code></li>
				<li><code>.h--alpha</code></li>
				<li><code>.list--bare</code></li>
				<li><code>.list--inline--c</code></li>
				<li><code>.dl--table--sml</code></li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="descendants">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Descendants</h1>
			<p class="prose draft"><em>Class</em> inheritance/descendants are different than <em>object</em> inheritance/descendants. A class child, or an extension, of a class is a class that inherits all the properties of its parent. On the other hand, a component child of an object is literally an object within an object (for example, a <code>p</code> within a <code>section</code>). Some properties such as <code>color</code> and <code>font-weight</code> are inherited through object inheritance, but other properties such as <code>border</code> are not.</p>
			<p class="prose">With <a href="#descendant-selectors">some exceptions</a>, descendant selectors are usually avoided, so indicating that one class of HTML element belongs as a descendent of another class of element is <a>not specified via selector</a>: it is usually specified in some sort of documentation. However it is advantageous to additionaly <strong>indicate so in the classname</strong> for extra unambiguity, without sacrificing specificity or efficiency. This way, the developer knows that the element belongs inside the other by inspection.</p>
			<p class="prose">In the name of a class that is a descendant of another class, the &ldquo;parent classname&rdquo; and &ldquo;child classname&rdquo; are separated by two underscores. This similar to the practice of using one underscore to indicate namespaces. (In a way, the child classname is in the parent classname namespace.) If a child classname such as <code>.bar__foo</code> exists, it is assumed that a classname <code>.bar</code> exists.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>.bc__anc</code></li>
				<li><code>.fnotes__fn</code></li>
				<li><code>.lang--html__tag</code></li>
				<li><code>.res_skilldetail__job</code></li>

<section id="selectors">
	<h1 class="h--beta">Guidelines for Writing Selectors</h1>
	<p class="prose">Each selector has a <a>specificity</a> and an <a>efficiency</a>. I won't talk about them too much here, but generally the more efficient a selector is, the more specific it gets, and vice versa: less specific selectors are usually not that efficient. Our goal is to find the right balance between keeping our selectors low in specificity while high in efficiency.</p>
	<p class="prose">The majority of the selectors in a stylesheet should be single classes only. Class selectors are the most efficient way for browsers to style pages, <a>not counting IDs</a>. For the most part, use single class selectors.</p>
	<p class="prose"><span class="lede-sent">Content before presentation.</span> There are exceptions to the &ldquo;single-class&rdquo; rule. When it comes down to efficient HTML versus efficient CSS, HTML wins. The reason? Semantics always trumps style. You've got a problem when you find yourself having to adjust a huge amount of HTML just to conform to CSS best practices (such as adding 8 different classes to an element to get it to look exactly how you want). It should be the other way around. CSS should conform to how HTML is (or should be) written, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of efficiency.</p>
	<section id="descendant-selectors">
		<h1 class="h--gamma">Child and Descendant Selectors</h1>
		<p class="prose"><a href="#subcomponents">As stated above</a>, it is best practice to avoid child selectors (<code>.parent &gt; .child</code>) and descendant selectors (<code>.ancestor .descendant</code>). However there are some cases in which this is okay, and these cases involve intrinsic ownership: elements that belong to other elements by HTML standards.</p>
		<section id="lists">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Lists</h1>
			<p class="prose">The following CSS is <em>very</em> efficient and not very specific at all. This is normally very good coding:</p>
			<code class="code--block">
<span class="code__sel">.nav {<span class="code__prop">&hellip;</span>}</span>
<span class="code__sel">.nav__link {<span class="code__prop">&hellip;</span>}</span>
			</code>
			<code class="code--block">
<span class="code__tag">&lt;ol <span class="code__attr">class=&quot;<span class="code__val">nav</span>&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
	<span class="code__tag">&lt;li <span class="code__attr">class=&quot;<span class="code__val">nav__link</span>&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;a&gt;</span>link 1<span class="code__tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
	<span class="code__tag">&lt;li <span class="code__attr">class=&quot;<span class="code__val">nav__link</span>&quot;</span>&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;a&gt;</span>link 2<span class="code__tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="code__tag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
			</code>
			<p class="prose">While this is usually best practice, the issue here is that each list item requires the class <code>.nav__link</code>, and that every time an item gets added to the list, the class has to be added again. While this may be efficient CSS, this is very <em>inefficient</em> HTML and it's not very <abbr title="don't repeat yourself">DRY</abbr>. For instance, if the list item classname were to change in the <a>Theoretical Redesign Future&trade;</a>, we would have to go back and change all the classes on each list item in the HTML.</p>
			<p class="prose">In this case it is better to view the list as one component, with the list items as subcomponents of that component. Here we are using a class selector to target the <code>ol</code>, but we are permitted to use an element selector to target the <code>li</code>s inside. Yes, the selector <code>.nav &gt; li</code> is more specific than <code>.nav__link</code>, but that is a small price to pay for more efficient HTML.</p>
			<code class="code--block">
<span class="code__sel">.nav {<span class="code__prop">&hellip;</span>}</span>
<span class="code__sel">nav &gt; li {<span class="code__prop">&hellip;</span>}</span>
			</code>
			<code class="code--block">
<span class="code__tag">&lt;ol <span class="code__attr">class=&quot;<span class="code__val">nav</span>&quot;</span>&gt;</span>
	<span class="code__tag">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;a&gt;</span>link 1<span class="code__tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
	<span class="code__tag">&lt;li&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;a&gt;</span>link 2<span class="code__tag">&lt;/a&gt;</span><span class="code__tag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="code__tag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
			</code>
		</section>
		<section id="tables">
			<h1 class="h--delta">Tables</h1>
			<p class="prose">I'm not going to give any examples here, but selectors describing any <code>thead</code>, <code>tbody</code>, <code>tfoot</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>th</code>, or <code>td</code> elements, etc. inside any <code>table</code> elements are acceptable exceptions to the &ldquo;single-class&rdquo; rule.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1 class="h--delta">Miscellaneous Groupings</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><code>h1 &gt; .h__sub</code>, etc. a subheading element within a heading 1 (as opposed to a heading 2, etc.). Otherwise we would need <code>.h1__sub</code> through <code>.h6__sub</code>.</li>
				<li><code>.fn a</code>, a link inside a footnote superscript</li>
				<li><code>blockquote &gt; cite</code>, a citation inside a blockquote</li>
