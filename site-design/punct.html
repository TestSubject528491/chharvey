<p class="prose">This document provides suggested use for punctuation symbols when writing for the Web.</p>
<section id="punct-common">
	<h1 class="h-beta">Common Punctuation</h1>
	<section>
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Apostrophes</h1>
		<p class="prose">Normal and efficient typing would dictate that apostrophes, in both possessive nouns and contractions, use the apostrophe key on the keyboard (next to the <kbd><kbd>return</kbd></kbd> key). However, in very formal documents, such as those presented to peers or those soon to be published, authors are encouraged to use the <b class="ref">right single-quote</b> entity (<kbd><kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd></kbd> on a Mac, or <code class="lang-html">&amp;rsquo;</code> in HTML) as it is more typographically appropriate. See the examples below for differences in rendering.</p>
		<figure>
			<p>The word &ldquo;I'm&rdquo; is a contraction with a regular apostrophe, while the word &ldquo;Cody&rsquo;s&rdquo; is a possessive noun that uses the right single-quote character. Notice the difference in characters.</p>

<section id="punct-pauses">
	<h1 class="h-beta">Pauses and Interruptions</h1>
	<section id="colon">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">The Colon</h1>
		<p class="prose">A colon separates a complete sentence and a list or example. See the figures below.</p>
		<figure>The following sentence is correct: &ldquo;I have two favorite hobbies: reading and writing.&rdquo;</figure>
		<figure>An incorrect usage would be: &ldquo;My two favorite hobbies are: reading and writing.&rdquo;</figure>
		<p class="prose">In general, a colon can almost always be replaced with the word &ldquo;namely.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="prose">A colon usually precedes a list or some sort of enumeration, either implicitly (in prose) or explicitly (via an actual bulleted or numbered list). Colons can also precede an example or illustration. See the introduction of each example above.</p>
		<p class="prose">The first letter of the first word following a colon is usually not capitalized. There are two exceptions: if the list items in a bulleted list that follow are capitalized, and if the colon separates a title and subtitle of, for example, a book.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="emdash">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">The Dash</h1>
		<p class="prose">When unspecified, the word &ldquo;dash&rdquo; almost always refers to the <b class="ref">em dash</b> (<kbd><kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd></kbd> on a Mac, or <code class="lang-html">&amp;mdash;</code> in HTML).</p>
		<p class="prose">The single dash, like the colon, can be used to indicate a pause or interruption in prose. However, dashes are stronger and more informal than colons.</p>
		<figure>
			I have two hobbies: cooking and cleaning.
			<figcaption>This example could be read, <i class="thought">I have two hobbies, and I'm going to tell you what they are. Cooking and cleaning.</i></figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			I have two hobbies&mdash;cooking and cleaning.
			<figcaption>This one could be read, <i class="thought">I have two hobbies. Wait for it, wait for it. Cooking and cleaning!</i> This is not a good use of the em dash.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			When we boarded the plane, we realized we only forgot one thing&mdash;the baby.
			<figcaption>A more appropriate use of the em dash.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p class="prose">Don't use dashes for the boring or mundane. Dashes are dramatic. Also, notice the lack of spaces surrounding the dash. This is the common practice.</p>
		<p class="prose">Dashes are not hyphens. Hyphens (found next to the <kbd><kbd>0</kbd></kbd>) are used for compound words and a bunch of other stuff that I'm not really sure about. But they don't indicate pauses. The same goes for <b class="ref">en dashes</b> (<kbd><kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd></kbd> or <code class="lang-html">&amp;ndash;</code>). En dashes indicate an inclusive range of numbers and could be replaced by the word &ldquo;to.&rdquo;</p>

<section id="punct-phrases">
	<h1 class="h-beta">Separated Phrases</h1>
	<section id="parens">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Parentheses</h1>
		<p class="prose">A single open parenthesis begins an aside and is always paired with a closing parenthesis. Together, these two parentheses separate the aside from the surrounding prose.</p>
		<p class="prose">The phrase inside the parentheses is extraneous information (which means it could be removed without disrupting the flow of prose or changing its meaning). The sentence you just read was a bad example of using parentheses because the remark inside was integral to the sentence (it explained what &ldquo;extraneous information&rdquo; meant). That last one was okay, though. When deciding whether to use parentheses, ask yourself, &ldquo;Is this information a necessary part of the sentence?&rdquo; If not, it's okay to place it in parentheses.</p>
		<figure>They fled through the woods, and then found George (dear, sweet George the accountant) lying dead in the creek.</figure>
	</section>
	<section id="emdash-phrase">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Dashes: Part Two</h1>
		<p class="prose">The em dash&mdash;apart from indicating a pause&mdash;can also be used with a twin to indicate asides. In contrast to parentheses, dashes are used to highlight a phrase and bring it to the reader's attention. Remember, dashes are dramatic. If the aside were removed, the sentence would convey a different mood because that information removed would no longer be worth any attention.</p>
		<p class="prose">The first sentence in the preceeding paragraph uses a pair of em dashes to highlight the fact that em dashes have another function: they may indicate a pause. Re-read the sentence without the aside (<q cite="#emdash-phrase">The em dash can also be used with a twin&hellip;</q>) and see how the meaning changes.</p>
		<p class="prose">Again, the dashes should be adjacent to the words inside and out. There should be no immediate spaces or punctuation next to the dash.</p>
		<figure>They fled through the woods, and then George&mdash;dear, sweet George the accountant&mdash;jumped out and stabbed them.</figure>
	</section>
	<section id="comma">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Commas</h1>
		<p class="prose">There are just too many rules about commas, so I won't talk about them all. But below are a few examples of when commas can be used to separate a clause from a sentence.</p>
		<section>
			<h1 class="h-delta">Appositives</h1>
			<figure>My first dog, Axel, was found astray.</figure>
			<p class="prose">Axel's name is unnecessarily included because I can only have one first dog. His name and the commas may be removed without changing the sentence's semantics. A counterexample would be, &ldquo;My dog Axel is at the vet.&rdquo; If I have more than one dog, I need to clarify which one is at the vet in this case. I can't surround his name with commas.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1 class="h-delta">Nonrestrictive Clauses</h1>
			<figure>Diamonds, which are expensive, aren't something I buy often.</figure>
			<p class="prose">All diamonds are expensive, so there's no need to indicate this in the sentence. Remove the phrase and commas and the meaning stays the same. On the other hand, &ldquo;Diamonds that are found in the ocean are very rare&rdquo; is not a nonrestrictive clause (it's a restrictive clause) because it distinguishes diamonds that are found in the ocean from other diamonds. We can't surround the clause <q>that are found in the ocean</q> with commas.</p>
		</section>

</section>
<section id="punct-expressions">
	<h1 class="h-beta">Other Expressions</h1>
	<section id="scare-mention">
		<h1 class="h-gamma">Scare Quotes and Mentions</h1>
		<p class="prose">Mark up scare quotes and mentions with the <b class="ref">left and right double-quote</b> entities (<kbd><kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd></kbd> and <kbd><kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd></kbd> on a Mac, or <code class="lang-html">&amp;ldquo;</code> and <code class="lang-html">&amp;rdquo;</code> in HTML).</p>
		<p class="prose"><dfn id="d-scare-quote">Scare quotes</dfn> are expressions that abuse vocabulary or language, sarcastic expressions, double entendres, metaphors or analogies, onomatopoeias, and other idioms of the like. In spoken language, people typically indicate scare quotes by making the quote signs: by holding their hands up and bending the first two fingers on each hand. If you would do this while speaking a word or phrase, it's most likely a scare quote.</p>
		<figure>My hair is not &ldquo;black;&rdquo; it's just very dark brown.</figure>
		<figure>Yes, I'm &ldquo;sorry&ldquo; your cat found his way into my yard when the dog was hungry.</figure>
		<p class="prose">A mention refers to an explicit word or phrase without conveying meaning to the sentence. If the word or phrase could be replaced with nonsense and the sentence would still be syntactically correct, then it is a mention. However, if the word or phrase is integral to the meaning of the sentence, then <a class="sp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use%E2%80%93mention_distinction">it is not being <em>mentioned</em>, but rather <em>used</em></a>.</p>
		<figure>Don't use the word &ldquo;equals&rdquo; when you mean &ldquo;implies.&rdquo;</figure>
