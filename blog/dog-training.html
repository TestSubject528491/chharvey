<p class="P">The number one rule of dog training is to make it clear who is in charge. The
	first step in showing your authority is letting your dog know that you control all the
	resources. You must provide the food, water, bedding, toys, and everything your dog wants
	and needs. Your dog must have the idea that he can only use these resources with your
	permission. <strong class="philosophy">Dogs crave leadership.</strong> They feel comfortable
	being told what to do and when to do it. Training with this basic concept in mind will make
	developing your relationship with your dog all the easier.</p>
<section id="training">
	<h1 class="H Beta">Training is Teaching</h1>
	<p class="P">The relationship between you and your dog should be similar to that between
		teacher and pupil. Though <strong class="philosophy">dogs crave leadership</strong>, it is
		best to think of you as <em>teaching</em> your dog rather than <em>dominating</em> him. The
		best system of learning involves timely and effective rewards and proper management.</p>
	<section id="reward">
		<h1 class="H Gamma">Effective Rewards and <i>The Mark</i></h1>
		<p class="P">Also known as <i>positive reinforcement</i>, effective rewarding involves
			introducing a desired stimulus (such as treats, petting, praise), at the appearance of
			a behavior (such as sitting, fetching, or, possibly inadvertently, whining), thus
			increasing the frequency of that behavior. One example would be giving your dog a treat
			shortly after sitting at your command. An example of <em>accidental</em> effective
			rewarding would be comforting your dog while he&rsquo;s whining.</p>
		<p class="P">Having a marker, or <i>Mark</i>, can be a really useful asset when
			effectively rewarding your dog. Some trainers use a clicker, while I use the simple
			and clean keyword <q><b>Yes</b></q>. Using a Mark allows your dog to
			understand that <strong class="message">the behavior he exhibits when hearing the Mark
				is desired</strong>. Here&rsquo;s an example. I tell Axel to <b>Sit</b>,
				and then he puts his butt down. Without a Mark, I would praise
				<b>Good Boy</b>, and then present a treat. To receive the treat, he would have to
				stand up and come forward to take it. Now think about what kind of message the dog
				is receiving. He&rsquo;s being given a treat while standing up. Thus he associates the
				treat with standing up, and the action of standing up with the keyword
				<b>Sit</b>. Training without a Mark is possible but takes much more time.</p>
		<p class="P">With a Mark, the desired behavior is more clear. After a few days of simply
			treating to the keyword <b>Yes</b>, Axel starts to form an association between
			<b>Yes</b> and treats. This essential period <small>in which I&rsquo;m literally saying
				<b>Yes</b> and then giving Axel a treat</small> may seem like a waste of time, but
				it really pays off in the long run. During training, I tell Axel to <b>Sit</b>, and
				then he puts his butt down. The moment his butt touches the ground, I say <b>Yes</b>,
				with which Axel will have already formed the association to treats. Thus he knows
				that something good is coming, which just so happens to be at the same time his butt
				touches the ground. The association between that good feeling and putting his butt
				down is made. I can then wait sufficiently longer to treat him, and he still knows
				he&rsquo;s being treated for the sit, which happened ages ago.</p>
		<section>
			<h1 class="H Delta">The Hierarchy of Rewards</h1>
			<p class="P">In the domain of treats, dogs definitely have a preference. Scrumptious
				bits of ground beef and steak rise to the top of the list, followed shortly by
				savory dried bacon and dried salmon. Luckily, these are satisfactorily cheaper than
				commercial dog treats and can be found in any grocery store. Save these treats only
				for the <a class="Link" href="#emergency-come">Emergency Come</a>, lest you pamper
				your dog. Then comes the common flavored pellets and jerky you can find in your pet
				store. Though a bit more expensive, they&rsquo;re worth the price since your dog will
				do anything for a taste of these. After that, we start hitting the lower end of the
				spectrum with bits of egg or cheese, and then finally, dog biscuits and dog cookies
				are on the bottom of the list. They&rsquo;d be good for a mid-day snack, but
				otherwise not really effective as a training reward.</p>
			<p class="P">When it comes to praise, <strong class="philosophy">dogs value vocalization
				most of all</strong>. Unlike cats, who prefer a soft touch, dogs like to <em>hear</em>
				the praise of their owners. Petting is good too, but your dog will appreciate verbal
				praise over physical praise any time. The higher the pitch of your voice, the more
				he will like it.</p>

	<section id="management" style="page-break-before: always;">
		<h1 class="H Gamma">Proper Management</h1>
		<p class="P">To stop bad behavior, dog trainers in the past have resorted to positive
			punishment: introducing an undesired stimulus to a behavior, thus decreasing the behavior.
			In today&rsquo;s view, this is unethical, inefficient, and unproductive. The preferred
			method involves proper management.</p>
		<p class="P">Proper Management is simply <strong>eliminating the possibility for
			failure</strong>. A great example is counter-surfing. Axel used to love to jump on the
			counter. This was probably caused by one incident of licking even the tiniest of crumbs
			off the counter, thus sending the message that good things come from the countertop.
			To <i>manage</i> the situation, I kept making sure the counter was absolutely spotless.
			Axel may have jumped up again, but didn&rsquo;t find any goodies, therefore this behavior
			diminished over time. There was no need to introduce an undesired stimulus.</p>
		<p id="punishment" class="prose">That being said, some situations do deserve positive
			punishment. At these incidents, a simple <b>No!</b> or <b>Bad Dog!</b> will suffice.
			<strong>Never hit your dog.</strong> Frequent positive punishment is not recommended,
			however. First of all, positive punishment, just like positive reinforcement, must take
			place <a class="Link" href="#delayed-stimuli">in the act</a>. Not all times can you
			catch your dog in the act, so punishing him after the fact won&rsquo;t do a bit of good.
			Secondly, as a dog trainer, you need to <em>teach</em> what is desired and what is
			undesired. Punishing bad behavior forces the dog to guess what is the desired behavior,
			of which there are infinitely many possibilities. In other words, he knows what
			<em>not</em> to do, but must deduce what he <em>is</em> to do. And in a lot of cases,
			the dog has no idea what he is being punished for, because he is likely doing many
			things at once. Through a system of trial and error, the dog has to figure out and
			narrow down what behavior he is being punished for and what behavior is expected of him.
			This leads to a complicated relationship involving fear, desperate pleasing, and low
			self-esteem.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="delayed-stimuli">
		<h1 class="H Gamma">Catching Your Dog In The Act</h1>
		<p class="P"><strong class="philosophy">Dogs live in the moment.</strong> They do have
			long-term memory, but these memories are often buried deep inside their minds at an
			unconscious level. Most dogs can&rsquo;t remember what happened two minutes ago. Thus
			<strong>it is imperative to treat your dog&rsquo;s behavior immediately</strong>. With
			<a class="Link" href="#reward">rewards</a>, give the Mark, if you&rsquo;re using it, at
			the first sign of the desired action. Don&rsquo;t wait even a second, or else your dog
			will not know what is being Marked. If you&rsquo;re not using a Mark, treat immediately.
			<a class="Link" href="#punishment">Punishments</a>, if applicable, must take place
			during or immediately after the undesired behavior occurs. If you come home after work
			and find your furniture destroyed and garbage all over the floor, the absolute best
			thing you can do is to clean up and learn from the situation.</p>
		<p class="P">Dogs are not intelligent enough to understand grudges, let alone hold them.
			Though it may appear so, there is no such thing as <i>spite</i> in the dog world. Dogs
			also don&rsquo;t feel guilt. Their display of submissive behavior is to show that
			they&rsquo;re trying to please their leaders, not because they &ldquo;know that what
			they did was wrong&rdquo;.</p>

	<section id="walking">
		<h1 class="H Gamma">Walking</h1>
		<p class="P">Walking is a very crucial part of your dog&rsquo;s day. This is the time he
			ventures out into the neighborhood, takes in the multitude of scents and smells,
			interacts with neighborhood dogs and other animals (including people), and perhaps most
			importantly, marks his territory. <small>Territory marking is a very serious business
			for dogs. We may not realize it, but dogs are very particular about where, when,
			how much, and how often they pee.</small> Thus, walking your dog is an incredible
			bonding activity, and is the time when you and your dog get to know each other the
			most.</p>
		<p class="P">It is important to communicate with your dog while Walking. Even if it&rsquo;s
			just small talk, your dog loves hearing your voice. When you see something interesting,
			such as a frantically-scurrying squirrel or a plastic bag floating by, mention it! Say
			things like, <q>Look!</q> or <q>What&rsquo;s that??</q> Your dog has probably already
			noticed it before you did, but just showing interest (or at least pretending to) is
			enough to get him excited.</p>
		<p id="pack-walking" class="prose">Another big part of Walking is known as
			<i>Pack Walking</i>. Pack Walking is what dogs instinctively do with each other: they
			walk in packs with a clear indication of who is Alpha male. In your pack, you are the
			Alpha male. You decide when to go out for a walk, in what direction to go, when to pee,
			when to run, and when to say hi to other dogs. Let your dog understand this. Your dog
			should be mostly at your side or a little bit in front. There should be slack in the
			leash; if not, tug firmly until your dog backs up (or moves forward, if you&rsquo;re
			dragging him) to meet you. <b>Heel</b> is a great tool if mastered properly.</p>
		<p id="walking-order" class="prose">In the human world, letting a person enter or leave
			before you is a sign of courtesy. In the dog world, this is a sign of submission. When
			about to enter or leave a room, always make your dog <b>Sit</b> and <b>Stay</b> before
			crossing the threshold, then release him. When you make your dog wait for you to walk
			through the doorway first, you&rsquo;re saying, <q class="message">Going this way is my
			decision. You must follow me, but only until I say so.</q></p>
	</section>
	<section id="eating">
		<h1 class="H Gamma">Eating</h1>
		<p class="P">Part of showing your dog who&rsquo;s in charge is showing him who has control
			of the resources&mdash;including the food. In your pack, the person feeding the dog
			should be the same all the time. This person is viewed as the person who controls the
			food. Once a week, this person should hand-feed the dog. It may be kind of gross, but
			forcing your dog to eat out of your hand conveys, <q class="message">I provide and
			control the food, and you can eat it with my permission.</q></p>
		<p id="eating-order" class="prose">The second component of this leadership is making your
			dog wait until you&rsquo;re done eating before he eats. In the dog world, the Alpha
			male eats the prime food and the rest of the pack can have the scraps left over, once
			the Alpha is finished. But the leadership comes with a price: While the rest of the
			pack is eating, the Alpha must be on the lookout and provide protection for his pack.</p>
		<p class="P">An effective way to make sure your dog knows its dinner time is by using a
			signal phrase, like mine: <q><b>Are You Hungry?</b></q> Prepare the dog food before you
			start eating (this can be after you&rsquo;re done cooking the human food) so the dog
			knows it&rsquo;s time to eat. The smell also gets his saliva glands working so he gets
			hungry fast. You should expect your dog to wait patiently (<em>not beg</em>) in the
			kitchen, while you&rsquo;re eating.
	</section>
	<section id="greetings">
		<h1 class="H Gamma">Greetings</h1>
		<p class="P">Ten minutes before you leave, put your dog in his crate if he has one, and
			cover it completely. Get your keys and jacket ready, pack your items, then chill out
			for a ten minutes. This down-time between getting ready to leave and actually leaving
			eases your dog&rsquo;s anxiety about your departure. Give him time to settle down
			before you leave. Your leaving should be no big deal to your dog. To him, it should seem
			like you&rsquo;re just in the other room. You should convey the message,
			<q class="message">I&rsquo;ll be gone for a short while, but not to worry, I&rsquo;ll
			be back soon.</q></p>
		<p class="P">Your arrivals should be low-key too. The biggest mistake new dog owners make
			when coming home after work is greeting their dogs with lots of praise, love, hugs, and
			kisses. Giving your dog this kind of attention only exacerbates his anxiety. His time
			away from you will seem all the longer and become that much unbearable. He will become
			impatient, frustrated, and depressed.  When you get home, completely ignore your dog,
			including not making eye contact, for at least 5 minutes. Use this time to unpack and
			unwind. Then you can acknowledge his presence with calm and soft petting and praise.
			There is a time for being lovey-dovey (<i lang="la"><abbr title="exampli gratia">e.g.</abbr></i> playtime), but it is not during your
			entrances and exits.</p>

		<h1 class="H Gamma">Miscellaneous Tips</h1>
		<h2 class="H Delta">Crating</h2>
		<p id="crating" class="prose">Dogs are creatures that like to sleep in dark and enclosed
			spaces. Canines&rsquo; ancestors used to dig big holes in the ground for sleeping to
			protect themselves from predators. Others used to live in small caves. These dens were
			where the canines slept, ate, nursed, and felt safe. Giving Axel a crate lets him know,
			<q class="message">This is your room. You can personalize it how you want. You can feel
			safe here.</q> I use the command <b>Go To Bed</b> to tell him it&rsquo;s time to go to
			his crate. Axel&rsquo;s crate is where he stays when I leave. It&rsquo;s a place he can
			take his kongs, bones, and toys. He can bury them in there too. I keep his crate covered
			to let in just enough light for him to see. Crate training is also a great way to house
			train a dog. A dog will never eliminate in a place he calls <i>his room</i> unless
			he&rsquo;s ill or cannot possibly hold it in any longer. These cases are clearly not
			your dog&rsquo;s fault, so punishment is out of the question.</p>
