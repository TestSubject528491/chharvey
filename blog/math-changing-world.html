<p class="P Intro">The need to understand and be able to use mathematics in everyday life
  and in the workplace has never been grater and will continue to increase.</p>
<section>
  <h1 class="H Bet">Mathematics for Life</h1>
  <p class="P">Knowing mathematics can be personally satisfying and empowering. The
    underpinnings of everyday life are increasingly mathematical and technological.
    For instance, making purchasing decisions, choosing insurance or health plans,
    and voting knowledgeably all call for quantitative sophistication.</p>

  <h1 class="H Bet">Mathematics as a Part of Cultural Heritage</h1>

    of humankind, and citizens should develop an appreciation and understanding of that
    achievement, including its aesthetic and even recreational aspects.</p>

<section>
  <h1 class="H Bet">Mathematics in the Workplace</h1>
  <p class="P">Just as the level of mathematics needed for intelligent citizenship has
    increased dramatically, so too has the level of mathematical thinking and problem
    solving needed in the workplace, in professional areas ranging from health care
    to graphic design.</p>

<section>
  <h1 class="H Bet">Mathematics for the Scientific and Technical Community</h1>
  <p class="P">Although all careers require a foundation of mathematical knowledge, some
    are mathematics intensive. More students must pursue an educational path that will
    prepare them for lifelong work as mathematicians, statisticians, engineers, and
    scientists.</p>
