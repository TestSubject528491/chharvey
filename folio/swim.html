	<p class="prose prose-folio">I've been swimming since I was seven and have been coaching the sport since I was eighteen. Throughout my swimming career I've attended many swim camps and regional and state competitions. I love coaching and making connections between coaching, psychology, and teaching.</p>

	<h2>Coaching Philosophy</h2>
	<p>My coaching philosophy highlights four priorities: Safety, Sportsmanship, Spread, and Success. Aside from swimmers' safety, I support friendly competition within our team and among other teams. Development is also very important in these nine weeks, and I am proud of the many Dolphins who have dropped time and gotten personal bests this year. Last but not least, the Lakevale Dolphins have definitely shown high achievement for these past two years (seven and one!), and I know I will see more in the future!</p>

	<h2>Practices</h2>
	<p>One of the most frequent duties as a coach is to construct effective workouts. A workout is an agenda of things to complete during one practice. My workouts always include a warmup, a main set, and a warmdown. The main set of a workout can take many forms, but I usually like to have an &lsquo;entr&eacute;e&rsquo; and then a few &lsquo;side dishes&rsquo; to accompany it. Another form is to have a theme for the overall main set, broken up into sections. For example, we may do the same type of thing for different strokes.</p>
