  * A span of text to which the reader's attention should be brought for purposes of illustration.
  * This span is typically in a figure or example.
  * Note: There could be a more appropriate element to use. Namely:
  * - If the span of text has an emphasized meaning, use `em`.
  * - If the span of text relays an important concept, use `strong`.
  * - If the span of text is represented in an alternate voice/mood, use `i`.
  * - If the span of text is a key word, key phrase, or common expression, use `b`.
  * - If the span of text is relevant in a certain context, use `mark`.
